<p><span class="bold">ARCULF,<a name="ar1" id="ar1"></a></span> a Gallican bishop and pilgrim-traveller, who
visited the Levant about 680, and was the earliest Christian
traveller and observer of any importance in the Nearer East
after the rise of Islam. On his return he was driven by contrary
winds to Britain, and so came to Iona, where he related his
experiences to his host, the abbot Adamnan (679-704). This
narrative, as written out by Adamnan, was presented to Aldfrith
the Wise, last of the great Northumbrian kings, at York about
701, and came to the knowledge of Bede, who inserted a
brief summary of the same in his <i>Ecclesiastical History of the
English Nation</i>, and also drew up a separate and longer digest
which obtained great popularity throughout the middle ages as
a standard guide-book (the so-called <i>Libellus de locis sanctis</i>)
to the Holy Places of Syria. Arculf is the first to mention the
column at Jerusalem, which claimed to mark the exact centre of
the Inhabited Earth, and later became one of the favourite
Palestine wonders. Besides a valuable account of the principal
sacred sites of Judaea, Samaria and Galilee as they existed in the
7th century, he also gives important information as to Alexandria
and Constantinople, briefly describes Damascus and Tyre, the
Nile and the Lipari volcanoes, and refers to the caliph Moawiya I.
(<span class="scs">A.D.</span> 661-680), whom he pictures as befriending Christians and
rescuing the &ldquo;sudarium&rdquo; of Christ from the Jews. Arculf&rsquo;s
record is especially useful from its plans, drawn from personal
observation by the traveller himself, of the churches of the Holy
Sepulchre and of Mount Sion in Jerusalem, of the Ascension
on Olivet and of Jacob&rsquo;s well at Sichem. It is also a useful
witness to the prosperity and trade of Alexandria after the
Moslem conquest: it tells us how the Pharos was still lit up every
night; and it gives us (from Constantinople) the first form of the
story of St George which ever seems to have attracted notice in
Britain.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>Thirteen MSS, of the original Arculf-Adamnan narrative exist,
and fully 100 of Bede&rsquo;s abridgment: of the former, the most important,
containing all the plans, are (1) Bern, Canton Library, 582, of
9th cent.; (2) Paris, National Library, Lat. 13,048, of 9th cent.; a third
MS., London, B. Mus., Cotlon, Tib. D. V., of 8th-9th cents., though
damaged by fire and lacking the illustrations, is of value for the
text, being the oldest of all. Among editions the first is of 1619,
by Gretser; the best, that of 1877, by Tobler, in <i>Itinera et Descriptiones
Terrae Sanctae</i>; we may also mention that of 1870, by
Delpit, in his <i>Essai sur les anciens pelerinages à Jérusalem</i>; see also
Delpit&rsquo;s remarks upon Arculf in the same work, pp. 260-304;

<p><span class="bold">ARDASHIR,<a name="ar2" id="ar2"></a></span> the modern form of the Persian royal name
<span class="sc">Artaxerxes</span> (<i>q.v.</i>), &ldquo;he whose empire is excellent.&rdquo; After the
three Achaemenian kings of this name, it occurs in Armenia, in
the shortened form Artaxias (Armenian, Artashes or Artaxes),
and among the dynasts of Persia who maintained their independence
during the Parthian period (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Persis</a></span>). One of these,
(1) Artaxerxes or <span class="sc">Ardashir I</span>. (in his Greek inscriptions he calls
himself Artaxares, and the same form occurs in Agathias II. 25,
iv. 24), became the founder of the New-Persian or Sassanian
empire. Of his reign we have only very scanty information, as
the Greek and Roman authors mention only his victory over the
Parthians and his wars with Rome. A trustworthy tradition
about the origin of his power, from Persian sources, has been
preserved by the Arabic historian Tabari (Th. Nöldeke, <i>Geschichte
der Perser und Araber zur Zeit der Sasaniden, aus der
arabischen Chronik des Tabari</i>, 1879). He was the second son of
P&#257;pak (B&#257;bek), the offspring of Sassan (S&#257;s&#257;n), after whom the
dynasty is named. P&#257;pak had made himself king of the district
of Istakhr (in the neighbourhood of Persepolis, which had fallen
to ruins). After the death of P&#257;pak and his oldest son Shapur
(Sh&#257;hpuhr, Sapores), Ardashir made himself king (probably
<span class="scs">A.D.</span> 212), put his other brothers to death and began war against
the neighbouring dynasts of Persis. When he had conquered a
great part of Persis and Carmania, the Parthian king Artabanus
IV. interfered. But he was defeated in three battles and at last
killed (<span class="scs">A.D.</span> 236). Ardashir now considered himself sovereign of
the whole empire of the Parthians and called himself &ldquo;King of
Kings of the Iranians.&rdquo; But his aspirations went farther. In
Persis the traditions of the Achaemenian empire had always been
alive, as the name of Ardashir himself shows, and with them the
national religion of Zoroaster. Ardashir, who was a zealous
worshipper of Ahuramazda and in intimate connexion with the
magian priests, established the orthodox Zoroastrian creed as the
official religion of his new kingdom, persecuted the infidels, and
tried to restore the old Persian empire, which under the Achaemenids
had extended over the whole of Asia from the Aegean Sea
to the Indus. At the same time he put down the local dynasts
and tried to create a strong concentrated power. His empire is
thus quite different in character from the Parthian kingdom of the
Arsacids, which had no national and religious basis but leant
towards Hellenism, and whose organization had always been very
loose. Ardashir extirpated the whole race of the Arsacids, with
the exception of those princes who had found refuge in Armenia,
and in many wars, in which, however, as the Persian tradition
shows, he occasionally suffered heavy defeats, he succeeded in
subjugating the greater part of Iran, Susiana and Babylonia.
The Parthian capital Ctesiphon (<i>q.v.</i>) remained the principal
residence of the Sassanian kingdom, by the side of the national
metropolis Istakhr, which was too far out of the way to become
the centre of administration. Opposite to Ctesiphon, on the
right bank of the Tigris, Ardashir restored Seleucia under the
name of Weh-Ardashir. The attempt to conquer Mesopotamia,
Armenia and Cappadocia led to a war with Rome, in which he
was repelled by Alexander Severus (<span class="scs">A.D.</span> 233). Before his death
(<span class="scs">A.D.</span> 241) Ardashir associated with himself on the throne his son
Shapur, who successfully continued his work.</p>

<p>Under the tombs of Darius I. at Persepolis, on the surface of
the rock, Ardashir has sculptured his image and that of the god
Ahuramazda (Ormuzd or Ormazd). Both are on horseback;
the god is giving the diadem to the king. Under the horse of the
king lies a defeated enemy, the Parthian king Artaban; under
the horse of Ormuzd, the devil Ahriman, with two snakes rising
from his head. In the bilingual inscription (Greek and Pahlavi),
Ardashir I. calls himself &ldquo;the Mazdayasnian [<i>i.e.</i> &ldquo;worshipper of
Ahuramazda&rdquo;] god Artaxares, king of the kings of the Arianes
(Iranians), of godly origin, son of the god P&#257;pak the king.&rdquo;
(See Sir R. Ker Porter, <i>Travels</i> (1821-1822), i. 548 foll.; Flandin
et Coste, <i>Voyage en Perse</i>, iv. 182; F. Stolze and J.C. Andreas,
<i>Persepolis</i>, pl. 116; Marcel Diculafoy, <i>L&rsquo;Art antique de la Perse</i>,
1884-1889, v. pl. 14). A similar inscription and sculpture is on a
rock near Gur (Firuzabad) in Persia. On his coins he has the
same titles (in Pahlavi). We see that he, like his father and his
successors, were worshipped as gods, probably as incarnations of a
secondary deity of the Persian creed.</p>

<p>Like the history of the founder of the Achaemenian empire,
that of Ardashir has from the beginning been overgrown with
legends; like Cyrus he is the son of a shepherd, his future
greatness is predicted by dreams and visions, and by the calculations
of astronomers he becomes a servant at the court of King
Artabanus and then flies to Persia and begins the rebellion; he
fights with the great dragon, the enemy of god, &amp;amp;c. A Pahlavi
text, which contains this legend, has been translated by Nöldeke
(<i>Geschichte des Artachsh&#299;r i P&#257;pak&#257;n</i>, 1879). On the same
tradition the account of Firdousi in the Shahnama is based; it
occurs also, with some variations, in Agathias ii. 26 f. Another
work, which contained religious and moral admonitions which
were put into the mouth of the king, has not come down to us.
On the other hand the genealogy of Ardashir has of course been
connected with the Achaemenids, on whose behalf he exacts
vengeance from the Parthians, and with the legendary kings of
old Iran.</p>

<p>(2) <span class="sc">Ardashir II</span>. (379-383). Under the reign of his brother
Shapur II. he had been governor (king) of Adiabene, where he
persecuted the Christians. After Shapur&rsquo;s death, he was raised to
the throne by the magnates, although more than seventy years
old. Having tried to make himself independent from the court,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page449" id="page449"></a>449</span>
and having executed some of the grandees, he was deposed after a
reign of four years.</p>

<p>(3) <span class="sc">Ardashir III</span>. (628-630), son of Kavadh II., was raised to
the throne as a boy of seven years, but was killed two years
afterwards by his general, Shahrbaraz.</p>

<p><span class="bold">ARDEA,<a name="ar3" id="ar3"></a></span> a town of the Rutuli in Latium, 3 m. from the S.W.
coast, where its harbour (<i>Castrum Inui</i>) lay, at the mouth of
the stream now known as Fosso dell&rsquo; Incastro, and 23 m. S.
of Rome by the Via Ardeatina. It was founded, according to
legend, either by a son of Odysseus and Circe, or by Danae,
the mother of Perseus. It was one of the oldest of the coast
cities of Latium, and a place of considerable importance; according
to tradition the Ardeatines and Zacynthians joined in the
foundation of Saguntum in Spain. It was the capital of Turnus,
the opponent of Aeneas. It was conquered by Tarquinius
Superbus, and appears as a Roman possession in the treaty with
Carthage of 509 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>, though it was later one of the thirty cities
of the Latin league. In 445 <span class="scs">B.C.</span> an unfair decision by the Romans
in a frontier dispute with Aricia led, according to the Roman
historians, to a rising; the town became a Latin colony 442 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>,
and shortly afterwards it appears as the place of exile of Camillus.
It had the charge of the common shrine of Venus in Lavinium.
It was devastated by the Samnites, was one of the 12 Latin
colonies that refused in 209 <span class="scs">B.C.</span> to provide more soldiers, and
was in 186 used as a state prison, like Alba and Setia. In imperial
times the unhealthiness of the place led to its rapid decline,
though it remained a colony. In the forests of the neighbourhood
the imperial elephants were kept. A road, the Via Ardeatina,
led to Ardea direct from Rome; the gate by which it left the
Servian wall was the Porta Naevia; a large tomb behind the
baths of Caracalla lay on its course. The gate by which it left
the Aurelian wall has been obliterated by the bastion of Antonio
da Sangallo (Ch. Hülsen in <i>Römische Mitteilungen</i>, 1894, 320).</p>

<p>The site of the primitive city, which later became the citadel,
is occupied by the modern town; it is situated at the end of a
long plateau between two valleys, and protected by perpendicular
tufa cliffs some 60 ft. high on all sides except the north-east,
where it joins the plateau. Here it is defended by a fine wall
of <i>opus quadratum</i> of tufa, in alternate courses of headers and
stretchers. Within its area are scanty remains of the podium
of a temple and of buildings of the imperial period. The road
entering it from the south-west is deeply cut in the rock. The
area of the place was apparently twice extended, a further
portion of the narrow plateau, which now bears the name of
Civita Vecchia, being each time taken in and defended by a mound
and ditch; the nearer and better-preserved is about ½ m. from
the city and measures some 2000 ft. long, 133 ft. wide and 66 ft.
high, the ditch being some 80 ft. wide. The second, ½ m. farther
north-east, is smaller. In the cliffs below the plateau to the
north are early rock habitations, and upon the plateau primitive
Latin pottery has been found. In 1900 a group of tombs cut in
the rock was examined; they are outside the farther mound
and ditch, and belong, therefore, to the period after the second
extension of the city.</p>

<p><span class="bold">ARDEBIL,<a name="ar4" id="ar4"></a></span> or <span class="sc">Ardabil</span>, chief town of a district, or sub-province,
of same name, of the province of Azerbaijan in north-western
Persia, in lat. 38° 14&prime; N., and long. 48° 21&prime; E., and at
an elevation of 4500 ft. It is situated on the Baluk Su (Fish
river), a tributary of the Kara Su (Black river), which flows
northwards to the Aras, and in a fertile plain bounded on the
west by Mount Savelan, a volcanic cone with an altitude of
15,792 ft. (Russian triangulation), and on the east by the Talish
mountains (9000 ft.). Ardebil has a population of about 10,000,
and post and telegraph offices. Its trade, principally in the
hands of Armenians, is still important, but is chiefly a transit
trade between Russia and Persia by way of Astara, a port on
the Caspian 30 m. north-east of Ardebil. It is surrounded by a
ruinous mud wall flanked by towers; a quarter of a mile east of
it stands a mud fort, 180 yds. square, constructed according
to European system of fortification. Inside the city are the
famous sepulchres and shrines of Shaikh Safi ud-din and his
descendant Shah Ismail I. (1502-1524) the first Shiah shah of
Persia and founder of the Safavi dynasty. Plans and photographs
of the shrines were taken in 1897 by Dr F. Sarre of Berlin
and published in 1901 (<i>Denkmäler Persischer Baukunst</i>; 65 large
folio plates).</p>

<p>European and Chinese merchants resided at Ardebil in the
middle ages, and for a long time the city was a great emporium
for central Asian and Indian merchandise, which was forwarded
to Europe via Tabriz, Trebizond and the Black Sea, and also
by way of the Caucasus and the Volga. Since the beginning of
the 16th century, when Persia fell under the sway of the Safavis,
the place has been much frequented by pilgrims who come to
pay their devotions at the shrine of Shaikh Safi. This shrine
is a richly endowed establishment with mosques and college
attached, and had a fine library containing many rare and
valuable MSS. presented by Shah Abbas I. at the beginning
of the 17th century, and mostly carried off by the Russians in
1828 and placed in the library at St Petersburg. The grand
carpet which had covered the floor of one of the mosques for
three centuries was purchased by a traveller about 1890 for
100 pounds, and was finally acquired by the South Kensington Museum
for many thousands. This beautiful carpet measures 34 ft. by
17 ft. 6 in., and contains 380 hand-tied knots in the square inch,
which gives over 32,500,000 knots to the whole carpet (W. Griggs,
<i>Asian Carpet Designs</i>).</p>

<p><span class="bold">ARDÈCHE,<a name="ar5" id="ar5"></a></span> an inland department of south-eastern France,
formed in 1790 from the Vivarais, a district of Languedoc.
Pop. (1906) 347,140. Area, 2145 sq. m. It is bounded N.W.
by the department of Loire, E. by the Rhone which divides it
from Isère and Drôme, S. by Gard and W. by Lozère and Haute-Loire.
The surface of Ardèche is almost entirely covered by
the Cévennes mountains, the main chain, continued in the
Boutières mountains, forming its western boundary. Its centre
is traversed from south-east to north-west by the Coiron range
which extends from the Rhone to the Mont Mézenc (5755 ft.),
the highest point in the department, and the oldest of its many
volcanoes. These mountains separate the southern half of the
department, which comprises the basin of the Ardèche, from the
northern half which is watered by numerous smaller tributaries
of the Rhone, the chief of which are the Érieux and the Doux.
A few rivers belong to the Atlantic side of the watershed, the chief
being the Loire, which rises on the western borders of the department,
and the Allier, which for a short distance separates it
from Lozère. Nearly all the rivers of the department are of
torrential swiftness and subject to sudden floods. The scenery
through which they flow is often of great beauty and grandeur.
Natural curiosities are the Pont d&rsquo;Arc, over the Ardèche, and
the Chaussée des Géants, near Vals. The climate in the valley
of the Rhone is, in general, warm, and sometimes very hot;
but westward, as the elevation increases, the cold becomes more
intense and the winters longer. Some districts, especially in
summer, are liable to sudden alterations in the temperature.
Rye, wheat and potatoes are the chief crops cultivated. Good
red and white wines are grown in the hilly region bordering the
Rhone valley, the white wine of St Péray being highly esteemed.
The principal fruits are the chestnut, which is largely exported,
the olive and the walnut. In the rearing of silk-worms, Ardèche
ranks second to Gard among French departments, and great
numbers of mulberry trees are grown for the purposes of this
industry. The many goats and sheep of Ardèche make it one
of the chief sources of supply of skins for glove-making. Mines
of coal, iron, lead and zinc are worked, and the quarries furnish
hydraulic lime (Le Teil) and other products. Besides flour-mills,
distilleries and saw-mills, there are important silk-mills and
leather-works and paper-factories. Annonay is the principal
industrial town. The department exports wine, cattle, lime,
mineral waters, silk, paper, &amp;c. Hot springs are numerous,
and some of them, as those of Vals, St Laurent-les-Bains,
Celles and Neyrac, are largely resorted to. Ardèche is served
by the Paris-Lyon-Méditerranée railway and has some 43 m.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page450" id="page450"></a>450</span>
of navigable waterway. The department is divided into the
arrondissements of Privas, Largentière and Tournon, with 31
cantons and 342 communes. It forms the diocese of Viviers
and part of the archiepiscopal province of Avignon. It is in the
region of the XV. army corps, and within the circumscription
of the <i>académie</i> (educational division) of Grenoble. Its court
of appeal is at Nimes. Privas, the capital, Annonay, Aubenas,
Largentière and Tournon are the principal towns. Bourg-St
Andéol, Thines, Mélas and Cruas have interesting Romanesque
churches. Mazan has remains of a Cistercian abbey founded
in the 12th century to which its vast church belongs. Viviers
is an old town with a church of various styles of architecture
and several old houses.</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">ARDEE,<a name="ar6" id="ar6"></a></span> a market-town of Co. Louth, Ireland, in the south
parliamentary division, on the river Dee, 48 m. N. by W. from
Dublin on a branch of the Great Northern railway. Pop.
(1901) 1883. It has some trade in grain and basket-making.
The town is of high antiquity, and its name (Ather-dee) is taken
to signify the ford of the Dee. A form Ath-Firdia, however, is
connected with the ancient story of the warrior Cuchullain of
Ulster, who, while defending the ford against the men of Connaught,
was forced to slay many with whom he was on friendly
terms, and among them the warrior Firdia, whom he regarded
with special affection. A castle of the lords of the manor was
built early in the 14th century, and remains, as does another
adjacent fortified building of the same period. Roger de Peppart,
lord of the manor early in the 13th century, founded the present
Protestant church and a house of Crutched Friars. There was
also a house of Carmelite Friars, but neither of these remains.
Ardee received its first recorded charter in 1377. It had a full
share in the several Irish wars, being sacked by Edward Bruce
(1315) and by O&rsquo;Neill (1538); and it was taken by the Irish and
recaptured by the English in the wars of 1641, and was occupied
later by the forces of James II. and of William III. It returned two
members to the Irish parliament. A large rath, or encampment,
with remains of fortifications, stands to the south of the town.</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">ARDEN, FOREST OF,<a name="ar7" id="ar7"></a></span> a district in the north of Warwickshire,
England, the &ldquo;woodland&rdquo; as opposed to the &ldquo;felden,&rdquo; or
&ldquo;fielden,&rdquo; <i>i.e.</i> open country, in the south, the river Avon
separating the two. Originally it was part of a forest tract of far
wider extent than that within the confines of the county, and
now, though lacking the true character of a forest, it is still
unusually well wooded. The undulating surface ranges for the
most part from 250 to 500 ft. in elevation. Wide lands in this
district were held in the time of Edward the Confessor by Alwin,
whose son Thurkill of Warwick, or &ldquo;of Arden,&rdquo; founded the
family of the Warwickshire Ardens who in Queen Elizabeth&rsquo;s
time still held several of the manors ascribed to Thurkill in
<i>Domesday</i>. Shakespeare, whose mother Mary Arden claimed to
be of this family, knew the district well, living as he did at
Stratford; and its natural characteristics, then still unchanged,
inspired his pictures of forest life in <i>As You Like It</i>. The name
of the Forest of Arden, besides remaining a convenient designation
of a well-marked physical area, is preserved in such place-names
as Henley-in-Arden and Hampton-in-Arden.</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">ARDENNES,<a name="ar8" id="ar8"></a></span> a district covering some portion of the ancient
forest of Ardenne, and extending over the Belgian province of
Luxemburg, part of the grand duchy, and the French department
of Ardennes. Bruzen Lamartinière states in his <i>Dictionnaire
Géographique</i> that the Gauls and Bretons called it by a
word signifying &ldquo;the forest,&rdquo; which was turned into Latin as
<i>Arduenna silva</i>, and he thinks it quite probable that the name
was really derived from the Celtic word <i>ardu</i> (dark, obscure).
The Arduenna Silva was the most extensive forest of Gaul, and
Caesar (<i>Bello Gallico</i>, lib. vi. cap. 29) describes it as extending
from the Rhine and the confines of the Treviri as far as the
limits of the Nervii. In book v. the Roman conqueror describes
his campaign against Indutiomarus and the Treviri in the
Ardenne forest. Strabo gave it still greater extent, treating it
as covering the whole region from the Rhine to the North Sea.
It is safer to give it the more reasonable dimensions of Caesar,
and to accept the verdict of later commentators that it never
extended west of the Scheldt. At the division of the empire
of Charlemagne between the three sons of Louis the Débonnaire,
effected by the pact of Verdun in 843, the forest had become a
district and is called therein <i>pagus Arduensis</i>. It was part of
the division that fell to Lothair, and several of the charters
of 843 expressly specify certain towns as being situated in this
<i>pagus</i>. In the 10th century the district had become a <i>comitatus</i>,
subject to the powerful count of Verdun, who changed his style
to that of count of Ardenne.</p>

<p>The Belgian Ardennes may be said now to extend from the
Meuse above Dinant on the west to the grand duchy of Luxemburg
and Rhenish Prussia as far north as the Baraque de
Michel on the east, and from a line drawn eastward from Dinant
through Marche, Durbuy and Stavelot to the Hautes Fagnes
on the north, to the French frontier roughly marked by the
Semois valley in the south. Within these limits there are still
some of the finest woods in Europe, which seem to have come
down to us almost intact from the days of the Arduenna of
Caesar. Notable among these portions of the great forest are
the woods of St Hubert, the woods round La Roche, and those
of the Amerois, Herbeumont, and Chiny on the Semois. In the
grand duchy the forest has almost entirely disappeared, but
owing to the compulsory law of replanting in Belgium this fate
does not seem likely to attend the Belgian Ardennes.</p>

<p>In addition to being a forest the Ardennes is a plateau, and
it offers to the geologist a most interesting field of investigation.
The greater part of the Ardennes is occupied by a large area of
Devonian beds, through which rise the Cambrian masses of
Rocroi and Stavelot, and a few others of smaller size. Upon
the folded slates and schists which constitute these inliers the
Devonian rests with marked unconformity; but north of the
ridge of Condroz Ordovician and Silurian beds make their
appearance. Near Dinant carboniferous beds are infolded
among the Devonian. Along the northern margin lies the
intensely folded belt which constitutes the coalfield of Namur,
and, beneath the overlying Mesozoic beds, is continued to the
Boulonnais, Dover and beyond. The southern boundary of this
belt is formed by a great thrust-plane, the <i>faille du midi</i>, along
which the Devonian beds of the south have been thrust over the
carboniferous beds of the coalfield.</p>

<p>The Ardennes are the holiday ground of the Belgian people,
and much of this region is still unknown except to the few
persons who by a happy chance have discovered its remoter
and hitherto well-guarded charms. There is still an immense
quantity of wild game to be found in the Ardennes, including
red and roe deer, wild boar, &amp;c. The shooting is preserved
either by the few great landed proprietors left in the country,
or by the communes, who let the right of shooting to individuals.
Occasionally it is still stated in the press that wolves have been
seen in the Ardennes, but this is a mere fiction. The last wolf
was destroyed there in the 18th century.</p>

Belgium, E. by the department of Meuse, S. by that of Marne,
and W. by that of Aisne. In shape it is quadrilateral with a
cape-like prolongation into Belgium on the north. The slope
of the department is from north-east to south-west, though its
longest river, the Meuse, entering it in the south-east, pursues
a winding course of 111 m. in a north-westerly, and afterwards
through deep gorges in a northerly, direction. The other
principal river, the Aisne, crosses the southern border and takes
a northerly, then a westerly course, separating the region known
as Champagne Pouilleuse from the more elevated plateau of
Argonne which forms the central zone of the department and
stretches to the left bank of the Meuse. The highest points of
the department are found in the wooded highlands of the
Ardennes which, with an altitude varying between 980 and 1640
ft., cover the north and north-east. The climate is comparatively
mild in the south-west, but becomes colder and more rainy
towards the north and north-east. Agriculture is carried on to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page451" id="page451"></a>451</span>
most advantage in the Champagne and Argonne. Wheat and
oats are the predominant cereals. Potatoes, rye, lucerne and
other kinds of forage are also important crops. Pasturage is
found chiefly on the banks of the Aisne and Meuse and on the
plateau of Rocroi in the north. Horse-raising is carried on in
the neighbourhood of Buzancy in the south, and at Bourg-Fièele
in the north. Fruit-growing is confined to the west and
central districts. The working of slate is very important,
especially in the neighbourhood of Fumay, and quarries producing
freestone, lime-stone and other minerals are found in several places. Flour-mills, saw-mills, sugar-works, distilleries
and leather-works are scattered over the department,
but iron-founding and various branches of metal-working which
are active along the valley of the Meuse (Nouzon, &amp;c.) are the
chief industries. To these may be added wool-weaving, centred
at Sedan, and minor industries such as the manufacture of
basket-work, wooden shoes, &amp;c. Coal and raw wool are prominent
imports, while iron goods, cloth, timber, live-stock,
alcohol and the products of the soil are exported. Various
branches of the Eastern railway traverse the department. The
Meuse is canalized within the department, and the Canal des
Ardennes, uniting that river with the Aisne, and the lateral canal
of the Aisne are together about 65 m. long. Ardennes is divided
into five arrondissements: Mézières, Rocroi, Rethel, Vouziers
and Sedan, with 31 cantons and 503 communes. The department
forms part of the ecclesiastical province of Reims and of the
circumscriptions of the appeal-court of Nancy and the VI. army
corps. In educational matters, it is included in the <i>academic</i>
(educational area) of Lille. Mézières, the capital, Charleville,
Rocroi, Sedan and Rethel are the chief towns. Outside them
its finest examples of architecture are the churches of Mouzon
(13th century) and Vouziers (15th century).</p>

<p><span class="bold">ARDGLASS<a name="ar10" id="ar10"></a></span> (&ldquo;Green Height&rdquo;): a small town of Co. Down,
Ireland, in the east parliamentary division, at the head of a
rocky bay, in a picturesque situation between two hills, 32 m.
S. by E. of Belfast on a branch of the Belfast &amp; Co. Down
railway. Pop. (1901) 501. Soon after the Norman invasion it
became of the first importance as a port, a fact attested by the
remains of no fewer than five castles in close proximity, which
give the town a picturesque aspect. There are also an ancient
church crowning the eastern hill, and a curious fortified warehouse
(called the New Works), dating probably from the 14th
century, when a trading company was established here under a
grant from Henry IV. Ardglass was a royal burgh and sent
a representative to the Irish parliament. The chief industry is
the herring fishery. Ships of 500 tons may enter the harbour at
all times. In summer Ardglass is a frequented resort of visitors;
good bathing and a golf links contribute to its attractions.</p>

<p><span class="bold">ARDITI, LUIGI<a name="ar11" id="ar11"></a></span> (1822-1903), Italian musical composer and
conductor, was born in Piedmont, and studied music at the
Conservatoire in Milan, starting professionally as a violinist,
and touring with Bottesini, the double-bass player, in the
United States in 1847. He began composing at an early age,
and in 1840 produced an overture, followed by an opera
<i>I Briganti</i> in 1841, and other works. He paid frequent visits to America, conducting the opera in New York, where he produced
his <i>La Spia</i> in 1856. In 1858 he became conductor of the opera
at Her Majesty&rsquo;s theatre in London, and both in London and
abroad he became famous in this capacity, having the reputation
of being Madame Patti&rsquo;s favourite conductor. His vocal waltz
<i>Il Bacio</i> was often sung by her. In 1896 he published his
<i>Reminiscences</i>, and after a long and active musical life he died at Brighton on the 1st of May 1903.</p>

is served by the Chicago, Rock Island &amp; Pacific, the St Louis &amp;
San Francisco, and the Gulf, Colorado &amp; Santa Fé railways.
Ardmore is the market-town and distributing point for the
surrounding agricultural region, which is the home of a large
part of the Chickasaw and Choctaw nations. It is situated
890 ft. above the sea in a cotton and grain producing region, in
which cattle are raised and fruit and vegetables grown; coal,
oil, natural gas and rock asphalt (which is used for paving the
streets of Ardmore) are found in the vicinity. Ardmore is an
important cotton market, and has cotton gins, a cotton compress,
machine shops, bridge works, foundries, bottling works and
manufactories of cotton-seed oil, brick, concrete, flour, brooms,
mattresses and dressed lumber. At Ardmore are the Saint
Agnes Academy, a Catholic school for girls, and Saint Agnes
College for boys, a conservatory of music, Hargrove College,
and the Selvidge Commercial College. Near Ardmore is a
summer school on the Chautauqua (<i>q.v.</i>) system. Ardmore was
founded in 1887, and was incorporated in 1898.</p>

&amp; South-Western railway, and 29½ m. by the Lanarkshire
&amp; Ayrshire branch of the Caledonian railway. Pop. (1901)
6077. The rise of Ardrossan was due to the enterprise of Hugh,
12th earl of Eglinton, who began the construction of the present
town and harbour in 1806. The harbour was intended to be
in connexion with a canal from Glasgow to Ardrossan, but this
was only completed as far as Johnstone. Owing to the costliness
of the undertaking, and the death of the earl in 1819, the works
were suspended after an outlay of £100,000, but his successor
completed the scheme on a reduced scale at an expense of another
£100,000. The dock accommodation has since been considerably
extended, and the town enjoys great prosperity. Steamers
run every week-day to Arran and Belfast, and during summer
there is a service also to Douglas in the Isle of Man. The exports
consist principally of coal and iron from collieries and ironworks
in the neighbourhood; and the imports of timber, ores
and general goods. Shipbuilding thrives and the fisheries are
important. The town is governed by a provost and council.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Saltcoats</span> (pop. 8120), a mile to the south, is a popular seaside
resort, with a brisk trade, due to its proximity to Ardrossan

has ceased.</p>

<p>Ardrossan dates from an early period. The name Arthur
of Ardrossan is found in connexion with a charter dated 1226;
and Sir Fergus of Ardrossan accompanied Edward Bruce in his
Irish expedition in 1316, and in 1320 signed the appeal to the
pope, made by the barons of Scotland, against the aggressions
of England. The family of Ardrossan is now merged, by
marriage, in that of the earl of Eglinton and Winton. The castle
where Wallace surprised the English garrison and threw their
corpses into the dungeon, grimly styled &ldquo;Wallace&rsquo;s Larder,&rdquo;
was finally destroyed by Cromwell, who is said to have used
part of its masonry for the construction of the fort at Ayr; but
its ruins still exist.</p>

<p><span class="bold">AREMBERG,<a name="ar17" id="ar17"></a></span> or <span class="sc">Arenberg</span>, formerly a German duchy of
the Holy Roman Empire in the circle of the Rhine Palatinate,
between Julich and Cologne, and now belonging to the Prussian
administrative district of Coblenz. The hamlet of Aremberg
is at the foot of a basalt hill 2067 ft. high, on the summit of
which are the ruins of the castle which was the original seat of
the family of Aremberg.</p>

<p>The lords of Aremberg first appear early in the 12th century,
but had died out in the male line by 1279. From the marriage
of the heiress Mathilda (1282-1299) with Engelbert II., count
of La Marck (d. 1328), sprang two sons. The elder of these,
Adolf II, (d. 1347), inherited the countship of La Marck; the
second, Engelbert III. (d. 1387), the lordship of Aremberg,
which he increased by his marriage with Marie de Looz, heiress
of Lumain. The lordship of Aremberg remained in his family
till 1547, when it passed, by his marriage with Margaret, sister
of the childless Robert III., to John of Barbancon, of the great
house of Ligne, who assumed the name and arms of Aremberg,
and was created a count of the Empire by Charles V. He was
governor of Friesland, and for a while commanded the Spanish
and Catholic forces against the &ldquo;beggars,&rdquo; falling at the battle
of Heiligerlee in 1568. His son Charles (d. 1618) greatly increased
the possessions of the house by his marriage with Ann of
Croy, heiress of Croy and of Chimay-Aerschot, and in 1576 was
made prince of the Empire by Maximilian II. His grandson,
Philip Francis, was made duke in 1644 by the emperor
Ferdinand III., and was succeeded by his brother Charles
Eugene (d. 1681), who married Marie Henriette de Vergy de
Cusance, heiress of Perwez (d. 1700). Their son, Duke Philip
Charles Francis, was killed in 1691 fighting against the Turks,
and was succeeded by Leopold (1754), a distinguished soldier
of the War of the Spanish Succession, and patron of Rousseau
and Voltaire. His son Charles (d. 1778) was an Austrian field-marshal
during the Seven Years&rsquo; War, and married Louise
Margaret of La Marck-Lumain, heiress of the countship of
Schleiden and lordship of Saffenberg. By the peace of Luneville
(February 1801), the next duke, Louis Engelbert, lost the greater
part of his ancestral domain, but received in compensation
Meppen and Recklinghausen. On the establishment of the confederation
of the Rhine, his son Prosper Louis (to whom,
becoming blind, he had ceded his domains in 1803) became a
member (1806), and showed great devotion to the interests of
France; but in 1810 he lost his sovereignty, Napoleon incorporating
Meppen with France and Recklinghausen with the
grand-duchy of Berg, and indemnifying him by a rent of
240,702 francs. In 1815 he received back his possessions, which
were mediatized by the congress of Vienna, Recklinghausen
falling to Prussia and Meppen to Hanover. On account of the
one portion he became a peer of the Westphalian estates, and
by the other a member of the upper house in Hanover.
George IV. of England (9th May 1826) elevated the duke&rsquo;s
Hanoverian possessions to a dukedom under the title of Aremberg
Meppen. His brother Auguste Raymond, Comte de la Marck
(1753-1833), became famous during the early stages of the
French Revolution for his friendship with Mirabeau (<i>q.v.</i>).
Duke Prosper Louis died in 1861, and was succeeded by his son
Engelbert (d. 1875), who was followed in his turn by his son
Engelbert (b. 1872).</p>

<p>The duke of Aremberg is one of the wealthiest of the great
continental nobles. His feudal domain in Germany covers an
area of over 1100 sq. m., besides which he has large estates in
Belgium and France. The duke has residences in Brussels,
where he has a famous collection of pictures, and at the château
of Klemenswerth near Meppen.</p>

11,155. It rises picturesquely above the mouth of the river Nid,
with a good harbour protected by an island from the open waters
of the Skagerrack. The town itself occupies several islets, and
some of the houses are supported above the water on piles. The
chief exports are timber (very largely exported to Great Britain),
wood-pulp, sealskins and felspar. In 1879 Arendal ranked
second (after Christiania) as a ship-owning port; in 1899 it had
dropped to the fifth place. In and near the town are factories
for wood-pulp, paper, cotton and joinery; and at Fevig, 8 m.
north-east, a shipbuilding yard and engineering works. The
neighbourhood is remarkable for the number of beautiful and
rare minerals found there; one of these, a variety of epidote,
was formerly called Arendalite. Louis Philippe stayed here for

<p>The above succession is divisible into: (1) a lower series of
gritty and calcareous sediments, the &ldquo;Arenig Series,&rdquo; as it is
now understood; (2) a middle series, mainly volcanic, with
shales, the &ldquo;Llandeilo Series&rdquo;; and (3) the shales and limestones
of the Bala or Caradoc Stage. It was to the middle series
(2) that Sedgwick first applied the term &ldquo;Arenig.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In the typical region and in North Wales generally the Arenig
series appears to be unconformable upon the Cambrian rocks;
this is not the case in South Wales. The Arenig series is represented
in North Wales by the Garth grit and Ty-Obry beds, by the Shelve
series of the Corndon district, the Skiddaw slates of the Lake
District, the Ballantrae group of Ayrshire, and by the Ribband
series of slates and shales in Wicklow and Wexford. It may be
mentioned here that the &ldquo;Llanvirn&rdquo; Series of H. Hicks was
equivalent to the bifidus-shales and the Lower Llandeilo Series.</p>

<p><span class="bold">AREOI,<a name="ar21" id="ar21"></a></span> or <span class="sc">Areoiti</span>, a secret society which originated in
Tahiti and later extended its influence to other South Pacific
islands. To its ranks both sexes were admitted. The society
was primarily of a religious character. Members styled themselves
descendants of Oro-Tetifa, the Polynesian god, and were
divided into seven or more grades, each having its characteristic
tattooing. Chiefs were at once qualified for the highest grade,
but ordinary members attained promotion only through initiatory
rites. The Areois enjoyed great privileges, and were considered
as depositaries of knowledge and as mediators between God and
man. They were feared, too, as ministers of the taboo and were
entitled to pronounce a kind of excommunication for offences
against its rules. The chief religious purpose of the society was
the worship of the generative powers of nature, and the ritual
and ceremonies of initiation were grossly licentious. But the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page453" id="page453"></a>453</span>
Areois were also a social force. They aimed at communism in
all things. The women members were common property; the
period of cohabitation was limited to three days, and the female
Areois were bound by oath at initiation to strangle at birth any
child born to them. If, however, the infant was allowed to
survive half an hour only, it was spared; but to have the right
of keeping it the mother must find a male Areoi willing to adopt
it. The Areois travelled about, devoting their whole time to
feasting, dancing (the chief dance of the women being the grossly
indecent <i>Timorodee</i> mentioned by Captain Cook), and debauchery,
varied by elaborate realistic stage presentments of the lives and
loves of gods and legendary heroes.</p>

<p><span class="bold">AREOPAGUS<a name="ar22" id="ar22"></a></span> (<span class="grk" title="Hareios Pagos">&#7948;&#961;&#949;&#953;&#959;&#962; &#928;&#940;&#947;&#959;&#962;</span>), a bare, rocky hill, 370 ft.
high, immediately west of the northern rim of the acropolis of
Athens. The ancients interpreted the name as &ldquo;Hill of Ares.&rdquo;
Though accepted by some modern scholars, this derivation of
the word is rendered improbable by the fact that Ares was not
worshipped on the Areopagus. A more reasonable explanation
connects the name with <i>Arae</i>, &ldquo;Curses,&rdquo; commonly known as
<i>Semnae</i>, &ldquo;Awful Goddesses,&rdquo; whose shrine was a cave at the
foot of the hill, of which they were the guardian deities (Aeschyl.
Eumen. 417, 804; Schol. on Lucian, vol. iii. p. 68, ed. Jacobitz;
Paus. i. 28. 6).</p>

named after the hill, is to be compared in origin and fundamental
character with the council of chiefs or elders which
we find among the earliest Germans, Celts, Romans, and other
primitive peoples. Under the kings of Athens it must have
closely resembled the Boule of elders described by Homer; and
there can be no doubt that it was the chief factor in the work
of transforming the kingship into an aristocracy, in which it
was to be supreme. It was composed of ex-archons. Aristotle
attributes to it for the period of aristocracy the appointment
to all offices (<i>Ath. Pol</i>. viii. 2), the chief work of administration,
and the right to fine or otherwise punish in cases, not only of
violation of laws, but also of immorality (<i>ibid.</i> iii. 6; cf. Isoc. vii.
46; Androtion and Philochorus, in Müller, <i>Frag. Hist. Graec</i>.
i. 387. 17, 394 60).<a name="fa1a" id="fa1a" href="#ft1a"><span class="sp">1</span></a> This evidence is corroborated
by the remnants of political power left to it in later time, after
its importance had been greatly curtailed, and by the designation
Boule, which in itself indicates that the body so termed was once
a state council. In a passage bearing incidentally upon the
early constitution of Athens, Thucydides (i. 126. 8) informs us
that at the time of the Cylonian insurrection the Athenians, we
may suppose in their assembly (<span class="grk" title="Hekklesia">&#7960;&#954;&#954;&#955;&#951;&#963;&#943;&#945;</span>), commissioned the
archons with absolute power to deal with the trouble at their
discretion. From this passage, if we accept the Aristotelian view
as to the early supremacy of the Areopagitic council, we must
infer that a modification of the aristocracy in a popular direction
had at that time already taken place.</p>

<p>In addition to its political functions, the council from the
time of Draco, if not earlier, exercised jurisdiction in certain
cases of homicide (see below, <i>ad fin</i>.). The assumption that in
their criminal jurisdiction the Areopagites were called Ephetae
till after the legislation of Draco (of. Philoch. 58, in Müller,
<i>ibid</i>. 394) would explain the otherwise obscure circumstances
that, according to Plutarch (<i>Sol</i>. 19), Draco (<i>q.v.</i>)
in his laws mentioned only the Ephetae, and that Pollux (viii. 125)
included the Areopagus among the localities in which sat the
Ephetae.<a name="fa2a" id="fa2a" href="#ft2a"><span class="sp">2</span></a> The same assumption would supply a reason for the notion
entertained by many writers of later time that the Areopagitic council
was instituted by Solon (<i>q.v.</i>)&mdash;a notion partly explained also by the
desire of political thinkers to ascribe to Solon the making of a
complete constitution. Conformably with the view here presented we may
suppose that the name &ldquo;Boule of the Areopagus&rdquo; developed from the simple
term &ldquo;Boul&#275;&rdquo; in order to distinguish it from the new Boul&#275; (<i>q.v.</i>), or
Council of Four Hundred. The popular reforms of Solon (594 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>), so far
as they were carried into effect, tended practically to limit the
Council of the Areopagus, though constitutionally it retained all its
earlier powers and functions, augmented by the right to try persons
accused of conspiracy against the state (Arist. <i>Ath. Pol.</i> viii. 4). In
the exercise of its duty as the protector of the laws it must have had
power to inhibit in the Four Hundred, or in the Ecclesia, a measure
which it judged unconstitutional or in any way prejudicial to the state, and in
the levy of fines for violation of law or moral usage it remained
irresponsible. As censor of the conduct of citizens it inquired
into every man&rsquo;s source of income and punished the idle (Plut.
<i>Sol.</i> 22).</p>

<p>The tyrants (560-510 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>) left to the council its cognizance
of murder cases (Demosth. xxiii. 66; Arist. <i>Ath. Pol</i>. xvi. 8)
and probably the nominal enjoyment of all its prerogatives;
but their method of filling the archonship with their own kinsmen
and creatures gradually converted the Areopagites into willing
supporters of tyranny. Though hostile, therefore, to the policy
of Cleisthenes, their council seems to have suffered no direct
abridgment of power from his reforms. After his legislation
it gradually changed character and political sentiment by the
annual admission of ex-archons who had held office under a
popular constitution. In 487 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>, however, the introduction
of the lot as a part of the process of filling the archonship (see
<span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Archon</a></span>) began to undermine its ability. This deterioration
was necessarily slow; it could not have advanced far in 480 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>,
when on the eve of the battle of Salamis, as we are informed
(Arist. <i>Polit.</i> viii. 4, p. 1304a, 17; <i>Ath. Pol.</i> xxiii. 25; Plut.
<i>Them.</i> 10; Cic. <i>Off.</i> i. 22, 75), the council of the Areopagus
succeeded in manning the fleet by providing pay for the seamen,
thereby regaining the confidence and respect of the people.
The patriotic action of the council and its attendant popularity
enabled it to recover considerable administrative control, which
it continued to exercise for the next eighteen years, although
its deterioration in ability, becoming every year more noticeable,
as well as the rapid rise of democratic ideas, prevented it from
fully re-establishing the supremacy which Aristotle, with some
exaggeration, attributes to it for this period. Its prestige was
seriously undermined by the conduct of individual members,
whose corrupt use of power was exposed and punished by
Ephialtes, the democratic leader. Following up this advantage,
Ephialtes (462 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>), and less prominently Archestratus and
Pericles (<i>q.v.</i>), proposed and carried measures for the transfer
of most of its functions to the Council of Five Hundred, the
Ecclesia, and the popular courts of law (Arist. <i>Ath. Pol.</i> xxv. 2,
xxvii. 1, xxxv. 2; Plut. <i>Per</i>. 9). Among these functions were
probably jurisdiction in cases of impiety, the supervision of
magistrates and the censorship of the morals of citizens, the
inhibition of illegal and unconstitutional resolutions in the
Five Hundred and the Ecclesia, the examination into the fitness
of candidates for office, and the collection of rents from the sacred
property (of. Wilamowitz-Mollendorff, <i>Arist. u. Ath.</i> ii. 186-197;
Busolt, <i>Griech. Gesch.</i> (2nd ed.) iii. 269-294; G. Gilbert, <i>Const.
Antiq. of Sparta and Athens</i>, Eng. trans., 154 f.). It retained
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page454" id="page454"></a>454</span>
jurisdiction in cases of homicide and the care of sacred olive
trees. From this time to the establishment of the Thirty (462-404
<span class="scs">B.C.</span>) the Areopagitic council, degraded still further by the
opening of the archonship to the Zeugitae (457 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>) and by the
absolute use of the lot in filling the office, was a political nullity.
The first indication of a revival of its prestige is to be traced in
the action attributed to it by Lysias during the siege of Athens
(404 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>) (in <i>Eratosth.</i> 69: <span class="grk" title="prattousês men tês en Areiô Pagô boulês sôtêria">&#960;&#961;&#945;&#964;&#964;&#959;&#973;&#963;&#951;&#962; &#956;&#8050;&#957; &#964;&#8134;&#962; &#7952;&#957; &#7944;&#961;&#949;&#943;&#8179; &#928;&#940;&#947;&#8179; &#946;&#959;&#965;&#955;&#8134;&#962; &#963;&#969;&#964;&#951;&#961;&#943;&#945;</span>). After the surrender of Athens and the
appointment of the Thirty, the repeal of the laws of Ephialtes
and Archestratus prepared the way for the rehabilitation of the
council as guardian of the constitution by the restored democracy
(Arist. <i>Ath. Pol.</i> xxxv. 2; decree of Tisamenus, in Andoc. i. 84;
cf. Din. i. 9). Although under the new conditions the Areopagites
could not hope to recover their full supremacy, they did exercise
considerable political influence, especially in crises. In the time
of Demosthenes, accordingly, we find them annulling the election
of individuals to offices for which they were unfit (Plut. <i>Phoc</i>. 16),
exercising during a crisis a disciplinary power extending to life
and death over all the Athenians &ldquo;in conformity with ancestral
law,&rdquo; procuring the banishment of one, the racking of another,
and the infliction of capital punishment on several of the citizens.
This authority seems to have been delegated to them by the
assembly with reference either to individual cases or temporarily
to the whole body of Athenians (Din. i. 10, 62 f.; Aeschin.
iii. 252; Lye. <i>Leoc</i>. 52; Demosth. xviii. 132 f.; Plut. <i>Demosth</i>.
14). Religion, too, was their care (Pseud. Demosth. lix. 80 f.).
Lycurgus (<i>ibid</i>.) even goes so far as to claim chat by their action
during the crisis after Chaeroneia they had saved the state.
After the period of the great orators their influence continued
to grow. Demetrius of Phalerum empowered them to assist
the <i>gynaeconomi</i> in supervising festivals held in private houses
(<i>Philoch</i>. in Müller, <i>ibid</i>. i. 408. 143). Under Roman supremacy
in addition to earlier functions they had jurisdiction in cases
of forgery, tampering with the standard measures, and probably
other high crimes, the supervision of buildings, and the care of
religion and of education (Cic. <i>Fam</i>. xiii. i; <i>Att</i>. v. 9; Tac.
<i>Ann</i>. ii. 55; Plut. <i>Cic</i>. 24; <i>C.I.G.</i> i. 123. 9; <i>C.I.A.</i> ii. 476;
iii. 703, 714, 716; Acts xvii. 19). Their council acquired, too,
in conjunction with the assembly, with or without the cooperation
of the Five Hundred (or Six Hundred), the right to
pass decrees and to represent their city in foreign relations
(<i>C.I.A.</i> iii. 10, 31, 40, 41, 454, 457, 458). From the overthrow
of the Thirty to the end of their history they enjoyed a high
reputation for ability and integrity (Isoc. vii.; Demosth. xxiii.
65 f.; Val. Max. viii. 1. <i>Amb</i>. 2; Gell. xii. 7; Lucian, <i>Bis Acc.</i>
iv. 12. 14). About <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 400 their council came to an end (Theodoret,
<i>Curat</i>. ix. 55).</p>

<p>With regard to the jurisdiction of the council in cases of
homicide, the procedure, so far as it may be gathered from the
orators and other sources, was as follows:&mdash;accusations were
brought by relatives within the circle of brothers&rsquo; and sisters&rsquo;
children, supported by the wider kin and the phratry (Demosth.
xliii. 57). On receiving the accusation the king-archon by
proclamation warned the accused to keep away from temples
and other places forbidden to such persons. He made three
investigations of the case in the three successive months, and
brought it to trial in the fourth month. As he was forbidden to
hand a case over to his successor, it resulted that in the last three
months of the year no accusations of homicide could be brought
(Ant. vi. 42). After the examination he assigned the case to
the proper court, and presided over it during the trial, which
took place in the open air, that the judges and the accuser might
not be polluted by being brought under the same roof with the
offender (Ant. v. 11). The accuser and the accused, standing
on two white stones termed &ldquo;Relentlessness&rdquo; (<span class="grk" title="Anaideia">&#7944;&#957;&#945;&#943;&#948;&#949;&#953;&#945;</span>) and
&ldquo;Outrage&rdquo; (<span class="grk" title="Hubois">&#8029;&#946;&#959;&#953;&#962;</span>) respectively (Paus. i. 28. 5), bound themselves
to the truth by most solemn oaths (Demosth. xxiii. 68).
Each was allowed two speeches, and the trial lasted three days.
After the first speech the accused, unless charged with parricide,
was at liberty to withdraw into exile (Poll. viii. 117). If condemned,
he lost his life, and his property was confiscated. A
tie vote acquitted (Aeschyl. <i>Eumen</i>. 735; Ant. v. 51; Aeschin.
iii. 252). See further <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Greek Law</a></span>.</p>

<p><a name="ft1a" id="ft1a" href="#fa1a"><span class="fn">1</span></a> Neither Herodotus nor Thucydides tells us anything as to its powers;
but their silence on this point need not surprise us, as they had no
especial occasion for referring to the subject, and in general it may be
said that before the 4th century <span class="scs">B.C.</span> writers took little interest in
the constitutional history of the remote past. The statement of
Thucydides (i. 126. 8) that at the time of the Cylonian insurrection the
nine archons attended to a great part of the business of government does
not contradict the Aristotelian view, for their administration may well
have been under Areopagitic supervision (see also <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Archon</a></span>); and, as is
stated in the text, the supremacy of the council may have already
suffered considerable limitation. <i>The Eumenides of Aeschylus</i> is a
glorification of the institution, though for obvious reasons it is there
represented as an essentially judicial body.</p>

<p><a name="ft2a" id="ft2a" href="#fa2a"><span class="fn">2</span></a> It is possible also to explain the alleged absence
of reference to the Areopagitic council in the Draconian laws by the
supposition that Solon, while leaving untouched the Draconian laws
concerned with the cases of homicide which came before the Ephetae,
substituted a law of his own regarding wilful murder, which fell within
the jurisdiction of the Areopagites. This view finds strong support in
the circumstance that the copy of the Draconian laws (<i>C.I.A.</i> i. 61),
made in pursuance of a decree of the people of the year 409-408 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>,
does not contain the provision for cases of premeditated homicide; cf.
G. de Sanctis, <span class="grk" title="Attis">&#7944;&#964;&#952;&#943;&#962;</span>, 135. The relation of the Ephetae to
the court of the Areopagus is obscure; cf. Philippi, <i>Der Areopag und

<p><span class="bold">AREQUIPA,<a name="ar23" id="ar23"></a></span> a coast department of southern Peru, bounded
N. by the departments of Ayacucho and Cuzco, E. by Puno and
Moquegua, S. and W. by Moquegua and the Pacific. It is
divided into seven provinces. Area, 21,947 sq. m.; pop. (1896)
229,007. It is traversed by an important railway line from
Mollendo (Islay) to Puno, on Lake Titicaca, 325 m. long, with
extensions to Santa Rosa, Peru and La Paz, Bolivia. The
highest point reached by this line is 14,660 ft. The department
includes an arid, sand-covered region on the coast traversed
by deep gorges formed by river courses, and a partly barren,
mountainous region inland composed of the high Cordillera
and its spurs toward the coast, between which are numerous
highly fertile valleys watered by streams from the snow-clad
peaks. These produce cotton, rice, sugar-cane, wheat, coffee,
Indian corn, barley, potatoes and fruit. The mountainous
region is rich in minerals, and there is a valuable deposit of
borax near the capital, Arequipa.</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">AREQUIPA,<a name="ar24" id="ar24"></a></span> a city of southern Peru, capital of the department
of the same name, about 90 m. N.E. by N. of its seaport
Mollendo (107 m. by rail), and near the south-west foot of the
volcano Misti which rises to a height of 19,029 ft. above sea-level.
The population was estimated at 35,000 in 1896. The city is
provided with a tram line, and is connected with the coast at
Mollendo (Islay) by a railway 107 m. long, and with Puno, on
Lake Titicaca, by an extension of the same line 218 m. long.
The city occupies a green, fertile valley of the Rio Chile, 7753 ft.
above the sea, surrounded by an arid, barren desert. It is built
on the usual rectangular plan and the streets are wide and well
paved. The edifices in general are low, and are massively built
with thick walls and domed ceilings to resist earthquakes, and
lessen the danger from falling masonry. The material used is
a soft, porous magnesian limestone, which is well adapted to
the purpose in view. Arequipa is the seat of a bishopric created
in 1609-1612, and possesses a comparatively modern cathedral,
its predecessor having been destroyed by fire in 1849. It has
several large churches, and formerly possessed five monasteries
and three nunneries, which have been closed and their edifices
devoted to educational and other public purposes. The religious
element has always been a dominating factor in the life of the
city. A university, founded in 1825, three colleges, one of them
dating from colonial times, a medical school, and a public library,
founded in 1821, are distinguishing features of the city, which
has always taken high rank in Peru for its learning and liberalism,
as well as for its political restlessness. The city&rsquo;s water-supply
is derived from the Chile river and is considered dangerous
to new arrivals because of the quantity of saline and organic
matter contained. The climate is temperate and healthy, and
the fertile valley (10 m. long by 5 m. wide) surrounding the city
produces an abundance of cereals, fruits and vegetables common
to both hot and temperate regions. Pears and strawberries
grow side by side with oranges and granadillas, and are noted
for their size and flavour. The trade of the city is principally
in Bolivian products&mdash;mineral ores, alpaca wool, &amp;c.&mdash;but it
also receives and exports the products of the neighbouring
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page455" id="page455"></a>455</span>
Peruvian provinces, and the output of the borax deposits in the
neighbourhood. Arequipa was founded by Pizarro in 1540,
and has been the scene of many events of importance in the
history of Peru. It was greatly damaged in the earthquakes of
1582, 1609, 1784 and 1868, particularly in the last. It was
captured by the Chileans in 1883, near the close of the war
between Chile and Peru.</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">ARES,<a name="ar25" id="ar25"></a></span> in ancient Greek mythology, the god of war, or rather
of battle, son of Zeus and Hera. (For the Roman god, identified
with Ares, see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Mars</a></span>.) As contrasted with Athena, who added
to her other attributes that of being the goddess of well-conducted
military operations, he personifies brute strength and
the wild rage of conflict. His delight is in war and bloodshed;
he loves fighting for fighting&rsquo;s sake, and takes the side of the
one or the other combatant indifferently, regardless of the justice
of the cause. His quarrelsomeness was regarded as inherited
from his mother, and it may have been only as an illustration
of the perpetual strife between Zeus and Hera that Ares was
accounted their son. According to a later tradition, he was the
son of Hera (Juno) alone, who became pregnant by touching
a certain flower (Ovid, <i>Fasti</i>, v. 255). All the gods, even Zeus,
hate him, but his bitterest enemy is Athena, who fells him to
the ground with a huge stone. Splendidly armed, he goes to
battle, sometimes on foot, sometimes in the war chariot made
ready by his sons Deimos and Phobos (Panic and Fear) by whom
he is usually accompanied. In his train also are found Enyo, the
goddess of war who delights in bloodshed and the destruction
of cities; his sister, Eris, goddess of fighting and strife; and
the Keres, goddesses of death, whose function it is especially
to roam the battle-field, carrying off the dead to Hades. In
later accounts (and even in the <i>Odyssey</i>) Ares&rsquo; character is somewhat
toned down; thus, in the &ldquo;Homeric&rdquo; hymn to Ares
he is addressed as the assistant of Themis (Justice), the enemy
of tyrants, and leader of the just. It is to be noted, however, that
in this little poem he is to some extent confounded with the
planet named after him (Ares, or Mars).</p>

<p>The primitive character of Ares has been much discussed.
He is a god of storms; a god of light or a solar god; a chthonian
god, one of the deities of the subterranean world, who could
bring prosperity as well as ruin upon men, although in time his
destructive qualities obscured the others. In this last aspect
he was one of the chief gods of the Thracians, amongst whom
his home was placed even in the time of Homer. In Scythia
an old iron sword served as the symbol of the god, to which
yearly sacrifices of cattle and horses were made, and in earlier
times (as apparently also at Sparta) human victims, selected
from prisoners of war, were offered. Thus Ares developed into
the god of war, in which character he made his way into Greece.
This theory may have been nothing more than an instance of
the Greek tendency to assign a northern or &ldquo;hyperborean&rdquo;
home to deities in whose character something analogous to the
stormy elements of nature was found. But it appears that the
Thracians and Scythians in historical times (Herodotus i. 59)
worshipped chiefly a war god, and that certain Thracian settlements,
formed in Greece in prehistoric times, left behind them
traces of the worship of a god whom the Greeks called Ares.
The story of his imprisonment for thirteen months by the
Aloïdae (<i>Iliad</i>, v. 385) points to the conquest of this chthonian
destroyer of the fields by the arts of peace, especially agriculture,
of which the grain-fed sons of Aloeus (the thresher) are the
personification.</p>

<p>In Homer Ares is the lover of Aphrodite, the wife of Hephaestus,
who catches them together in a net and holds them up to the
ridicule of the gods. In what appears to be a very early development
of her character, Aphrodite also was a war goddess, known
under the name of Areia; and in Thebes, the most important
seat of the worship of Ares, she is his wife, and bears him Eros
and Anteros, Deimos and Phobos, and Harmonia, wife of Cadmus,
the founder of the city (Hesiod, <i>Theog.</i> 933). In the legend of
Cadmus and his family Ares plays a prominent part. His
worship was not so widely spread over Greece as that of other
gods, although he was honoured here and there with festivals
and sacrifices. Thus, at Sparta, under the name of Theritas,
he was offered young dogs and even human beings. The Dioscuri
were said to have brought his image from Colchis to Laconia,
where it was set up in an old sanctuary on the road from Sparta
to Therapnae. At Athens, he had a temple at the foot of the
Areopagus, with a statue by Alcamenes. It was here, according
to the legend, that he was tried and acquitted by a council of
the gods for the murder of Halirrhothius, who had violated
Alcippe, the daughter of Ares by Agraulos. The figure of Ares
appears in various stories of ancient mythology. Thus, he
engages in combat with Heracles on two occasions to avenge the
death of his son Cycnus; once Zeus separates the combatants
by a flash of lightning, but in the second encounter he is severely
wounded by his adversary, who has the active support of Athena;
maddened by jealousy, he changes himself into the boar which
slew Adonis, the favourite of Aphrodite; and stirs up the war
between the Lapithae and Centaurs. His attributes were the
spear and the burning torch, symbolical of the devastation
caused by war (in ancient times the hurling of a torch was the
signal for the commencement of hostilities). The animals sacred
to him were the dog and the vulture.</p>

<p>The worship of Ares being less general throughout Greece than
that of the gods of peace, the number of statues of him is small;
those of Ares-Mars, among the Romans, are more frequent.
Previous to the 5th century <span class="scs">B.C.</span> he was represented as full-bearded,
grim-featured and in full armour. From that time,
apparently under the influence of Athenian sculptors, he was
conceived as the ideal of a youthful warrior, and was for a time
associated with Aphrodite and Eros. He then appears as a
vigorous youth, beardless, with curly hair, broad head and
stalwart shoulders, with helmet and chlamys. In the Villa
Ludovisi statue (after the style of Lysippus) he appears seated,
in an attitude of thought; his arms are laid aside, and Eros
peeps out at his feet. In the Borghese Ares (also taken for
Achilles) he is standing, his only armour being the helmet on his
head. He also appears in many other groups, with Aphrodite,
in marble and on engraved gems of Roman times. But before
this grouping had recommended itself to the Romans, with their
legend of Mars and Rhea Silvia, the Greek Ares had again
become under Macedonian influence a bearded, armed and
powerful god.</p>

<p><span class="bold">ARETAS<a name="ar27" id="ar27"></a></span> (Arab. H&#257;ritha), the Greek form of a name borne by
kings of the Nabataeans resident at Petra in Arabia, (i) A
king in the time of Antiochus IV. Epiphanes (2 Mace. v. 8).
(2) The father-in-law of Herod Antipas (Jos. <i>Ant.</i> xviii. 5. 1, 3),
In 2 Cor. xi. 32 he is described as ruler of Damascus (<i>q.v.</i>) at the
time of Paul&rsquo;s conversion. Herod Antipas had married a
daughter of Aretas, but afterwards discarded her in favour of
Herodias. This led to a war with Aretas in which Antipas was
defeated.</p>

<p>An Aretas is mentioned in 1 Macc. xv. 22, but the true
reading is probably Ariarathes (king of Cappadocia). See

<p><span class="bold">ARÊTE<a name="ar28" id="ar28"></a></span> (O. Fr. <i>areste</i>, Lat. <i>arista</i>, ear of corn, fish-bone or

<span class="pagenum"><a name="page456" id="page456"></a>456</span>
to denote the sharp bayonet-like edge of a mountain (such as the
Matterhorn), that slopes steeply upward with two precipitous
sides meeting in a long ascending ridge. Hence the word has
passed into common use to denote any sharp mountain edge
denuded by frost action above the snowline, where the consequent
angular ridges give the characteristic &ldquo;house-roof

<p><span class="bold">ARETHAS<a name="ar29" id="ar29"></a></span> (<i>c.</i> 860-940), Byzantine theological writer and
scholar, archbishop of Caesarea in Cappadocia, was born at
Patrae. He was the author of a Greek commentary on the
Apocalypse, avowedly based upon that of Andrew, his predecessor
in the archbishopric. In spite of its author&rsquo;s modest
estimate, Arethas&rsquo;s work is by no means a slavish compilation;
it contains additions from other sources, and especial care has
been taken in verifying the references. His interest was not,
however, confined to theological literature; he annotated the
margins of his classical texts with numerous scholia (many of
which are preserved), and had several MSS. copied at his own
expense, amongst them the Codex Clarkianus of Plato (brought
to England from the monastery of St John in Patmos), and the
Dorvillian MS. of Euclid (now at Oxford).</p>

<p><span class="bold">ARETHUSA,<a name="ar30" id="ar30"></a></span> in Greek mythology, a nymph who gave her name to a spring in
Elis and to another in the island of Ortygia near Syracuse. According to
Pausanias (v. 7. 2), Alpheus, a mighty hunter, was enamoured of
Arethusa, one of the retinue of Artemis; Arethusa fled to Ortygia, where
she was changed into a spring; Alpheus, in the form of a river, made his
way beneath the sea, and united his waters with those of the spring. In
Ovid (<i>Metam.</i> v. 572 foll.), Arethusa, while bathing in the Alpheus,
was seen and pursued by the river god in human form; Artemis changed her
into a spring, which, flowing underground, emerged at Ortygia. In the
earlier form of the legend, it is Artemis, not Arethusa, who is the
object of the god&rsquo;s affections, and escapes by smearing her face with
mire, so that he fails to recognize her (see L.R. Farnell, <i>Cults of
the Greek States</i>, ii. p. 428). The probable origin of the story is the
part traditionally taken in the foundation of Syracuse by the Iamidae of
Olympia, who identified the spring Arethusa with their own river
Alpheus, and the nymph with Artemis Alpheiaia, who was worshipped at
Ortygia. The subterranean passage of the Alpheus in the upper
part of its course (confirmed by modern explorers), and the
freshness of the water of Arethusa in spite of its proximity to
the sea, led to the belief that it was the outlet of the river.
Further, according to Strabo (vi. p. 270), during the sacrifice of
oxen at Olympia the waters of Arethusa were disturbed, and a
cup thrown into the Alpheus would reappear in Ortygia. In
Virgil (<i>Ecl</i>. x. 1) Arethusa is addressed as a divinity of poetical
inspiration, like one of the Muses, who were themselves originally
nymphs of springs.</p>

<p><span class="bold">ARETINO, PIETRO<a name="ar31" id="ar31"></a></span> (1492-1556), Italian author, was born in
1492 at Arezzo in Tuscany, from which place he took his name.
He is said to have been the natural son of Luigi Bacci, a gentleman
of the town. He received little education, and lived for some years poor
and neglected, picking up such scraps of information as he could. When
very young he was banished from Arezzo on account of a satirical sonnet
which he composed against indulgences. He went to Perugia, where for
some time he worked as a bookbinder, and continued to distinguish
himself by his daring attacks upon religion. After some years&rsquo; wandering
through parts of Italy he reached Rome, where his talents, wit and
impudence commended him to the papal court. This
favour, however, he lost in 1523 by writing a set of obscene
sonnets, to accompany an equally immoral series of drawings
by the great painter, Giulio Romano. He left Rome and was
received by Giovanni de&rsquo; Medici, who introduced him at Milan
to Francis I. of France. He gained the good graces of that
monarch, and received handsome presents from him. Shortly
after this Aretino attempted to regain the favour of the pope,
but, having come to Rome, he composed a sonnet against a
rival in some low amour, and in return was assaulted and severely
wounded. He could obtain no redress from the pope, and
returned to Giovanni de&rsquo; Medici. On the death of the latter in
December 1526, he withdrew to Venice, where he afterwards
continued to reside. He spent his time here in writing comedies,
sonnets, licentious dialogues, and a few devotional and religious
works. He led a profligate life, and procured funds to satisfy
his needs by writing sycophantish letters to all the nobles and
princes with whom he was acquainted. This plan proved
eminently successful, for large sums were given him, apparently
from fear of his satire. So great did Aretino&rsquo;s pride grow, that
he styled himself the &ldquo;divine,&rdquo; and the &ldquo;scourge of princes.&rdquo;
He died in 1556, according to some accounts by falling from his
chair in a fit of laughter caused by hearing some indecent story
of his sisters. The reputation of Aretino in his own time rested
chiefly on his satirical sonnets or burlesques; but his comedies,
five in number, are now considered the best of his works. His
letters, of which a great number have been printed, are also
commended for their style. The dialogues and the licentious
sonnets have been translated into French, under the title
<i>Académie des Dames</i>.</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">AREZZO<a name="ar32" id="ar32"></a></span> (anc. <i>Arretium</i>), a town and episcopal see of Tuscany,
Italy, the capital of the province of Arezzo, 54 m. S.E. of Florence
by rail. Pop. (1901) town, 16,780; commune, 46,926. It is an
attractive town, situated on the slope of a hill 840 to 970 ft. above
sea-level, in a fertile district. The walls by which it is surrounded
were erected in 1320 by Guido Tarlati di Pietramala, its warlike
bishop, who died in 1327, and is buried in the cathedral; they
were reconstructed by Cosimo I. de Medici between 1541 and
1568, on which occasion the bronze statues of Pallas and the
Chimaera, now at Florence, were discovered. The town itself is
fan-shaped, the streets, which contain some fine old houses with
projecting eaves and many towers, radiating from the citadel
(Fortezza), which was constructed in 1502, and dismantled by
the French in 1800. The cathedral, close by, is a fine specimen of
Italian Gothic begun in 1277, but not completed internally until
1511, while the façade was not begun until 1880. The interior is
spacious and contains some fine 14th-century sculptures, those of
the high altar, which contains the tomb of St Donatus, the patron
saint of Arezzo, being the best; very good stained-glass windows
of the beginning of the 16th century by Guillaume de Marcillat,
and some terra-cotta reliefs by Andrea della Robbia. Another
fine church is S. Maria della Pieve, having a campanile and a
façade of 1216, the latter with three open colonnades running for
its whole length above the doors. The interior was restored to its
original style in 1863-1865. The Romanesque choir and apse
belong to the 11th century, the rest of the interior is contemporary
with the façade. In the square behind the church is a
colonnade designed by Vasari. In the cloisters of S. Bernardo, on
the site of the ancient amphitheatre, is a remarkable view of
medieval Rome. S. Francesco contains famous frescoes by Piero
de&rsquo; Franceschi, representing scenes from the legend of the Holy
Cross, and others by Spinello Aretino, a pupil of Giotto. There
are several other frescoes by the latter in S. Domenico. Among
the Renaissance buildings the churches of S. Maria delle Grazie
and the Santissima Annunziata may be noted. The collection of
majolica in the municipal museum is very fine, and so is that of
the Funghini family. In the middle ages Arezzo was generally on
the Ghibelline side; it succumbed to Florence in 1289 at the
battle of Campaldino, but at the end of the century recovered its
strength under the Tarlati family. In 1336 it became subject to
Florence for six years, and after intestine struggles, finally came
under her rule in 1384. Among the natives of Arezzo the most
famous are the Benedictine monk Guido of Arezzo, the inventor
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page457" id="page457"></a>457</span>
of the modern system of musical notation (died <i>c</i>. 1050), the poet
Petrarch, Pietro Aretino, the satirist (1492-1556), and Vasari, famous
for his lives of Italian painters. The town never possessed a distinct
school of artists.</p>

<p><span class="bold">ARGEI,<a name="ar36" id="ar36"></a></span> the name given by the ancient Romans to a number of rush puppets
(24 or 27 according to the reading of Varro, <i>de Ling</i>. <i>lat</i>. vii. 44,
or 30 according to Dionysius i. 38) resembling men tied hand and foot,
which were taken down to the ancient bridge over the Tiber (<i>pans
sublicius</i>) on the 14th of May by the pontifices and magistrates, with
the flaminica Dialis in mourning guise, and there thrown into the Tiber
by the Vestal virgins. There were also in various parts of the four
Servian regions of the city a number of <i>sacella Argeorum</i> (chapels),
round which a procession seems to have gone on the 17th of March (Varro,
<i>L.L.</i> v. 46-54; Jordan, <i>Rom. Topogr.</i> vol. ii. 603), and it has been
conjectured that the puppets were kept in these chapels until the time
came for them to be cast into the river. The Romans had no historical
explanation of these curious rites, and neither the theories of their
scholars nor the beliefs of the common people, who fancied that the
puppets were substitutes for old men who used at one time to be
sacrificed to the river, are worth serious consideration. Recently two
explanations have been given: (1) that of W. Mannhardt, who by comparing
numerous examples of similar customs among other European peoples
arrived at the conclusion that the rite was of extreme antiquity and of
dramatic rather than sacrificial character, and that its object was
possibly to procure rain; (2) that of Wissowa, who refuses to date it
farther back than the latter half of the 3rd century <span class="scs">B.C.</span>, and sees in
it the yearly representation of an original sacrifice of twenty-seven
captive Greeks (taking Argei as a Latin form of <span class="grk" title="Argeioi">&#7944;&#961;&#947;&#949;&#8150;&#959;&#953;</span>) by
drowning in the Tiber. This second theory is, however, not borne out by
any Roman historical record.</p>

university of Konigsberg, and was attracted to astronomy by F.W.
Bessel, whose assistant he became (October 1, 1820). His treatise on the
path of the great comet of 1811 appeared in 1822; he was, in 1823,
entrusted with the direction of the observatory at Åbo; and he exchanged
it for a similar charge at Helsingfors in 1832. His admirable

entrusted him with several missions as inspector and intendant of the
forces. In 1623 he was appointed intendant of justice, police and
finance in Auvergne, and in 1632 held similar office in Limousin, where
he remained till 1637. After the death of Louis XIII. (1643) he retained
his administrative posts, was intendant of the forces at Toulon
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page458" id="page458"></a>458</span>
(1646), commissary of the king at the estates of Languedoc
(1647), and intendant of Guienne (1648), and showed great
capacity in defending the authority of the crown against the
rebels of the Fronde. After his wife&rsquo;s death he took orders
(February 1651), but did not cease to take part in affairs of

returned from his embassy, ruined, and lost favour with Mazarin,
who removed him from his office of councillor of state. He then
gave up public affairs and retired to his estates, where he occupied
himself with good works. In September 1656 he entered the
Company of the Holy Sacrament, a secret society for the diffusion
of the Catholic religion. Besides writing the <i>Annals</i> of the
society, he composed many pious works, which were destroyed

d&rsquo;Argenson (1652-1721), son of the preceding, was born at
Venice on the 4th of November 1652. He became <i>avocat</i> in 1669,
and lieutenant-general in the <i>sénéchaussée</i> of Angoulême (1679).
After the death of Colbert, who disliked his family, he went to
Paris and married Marguerite Lefèvre de Caomartin, a kinswoman
of the comptroller-general Pontchartrain. This was
the beginning of his fortunes. He became successively <i>maître des
requêtes</i> (1694), member of the <i>conseil des prises</i> (prize court)
(1695), <i>procureur-général</i> of the commission of inquest into
false titles of nobility (1696), and finally lieutenant-general
of police (1697). This last office, which had previously been
filled by N.G. de la Reynie, was very important. It not only
gave him the control of the police, but also the supervision of
the corporations, printing press, and provisioning of Paris.
All contraventions of the police regulations came under his
jurisdiction, and his authority was arbitrary and absolute.
Fortunately, he had, in Saint-Simon&rsquo;s phrase, &ldquo;a nice discernment
as to the degree of rigour or leniency required for every case that
came before him, being ever inclined to the mildest measures,
but possessed of the faculty of making the most innocent
tremble before him; courageous, bold, audacious in quelling
<i>êmeutes</i>, and consequently the master of the people.&rdquo; During
the twenty-one years that he exercised this office he was a party
to every private and state secret; in fact, he had a share in every
event of any importance in the history of Paris. He was the
familiar friend of the king, who delighted in scandalous police
reports; he was patronized by the duke of Orleans; he was
supported by the Jesuits at court; and he was feared by all.
He organized the supply of food in Paris during the severe winter
of 1709, and endeavoured, but with little success, to run to
earth the libellers of the government. He directed the destruction
of the Jansenist monastery of Port Royal (1709), a proceeding
which provoked many protests and pamphlets. Under
the regency, the Chambre de Justice, assembled to inquire into
the malpractices of the financiers, suspected d&rsquo;Argenson and
arrested his clerks, but dared not lay the blame on him. On
the 28th of January 1718 he voluntarily resigned the office of
lieutenant-general of police for those of keeper of the seals&mdash;in
the place of the chancellor d&rsquo;Aguesseau&mdash;and president
of the council of finance. He was appointed by the regent to
suppress the resistance of the parlements and to reorganize
the finances, and was in great measure responsible for permitting
John Law to apply his financial system, though he soon quarrelled
with Law and intrigued to bring about his downfall. The regent
threw the blame for the outcome of Law&rsquo;s schemes on d&rsquo;Argenson,
who was forced to resign his position in the council of finance
(January 1720). By way of compensation he was created
inspector-general of the police of the whole kingdom, but had
to resign his office of keeper of the seals (June 1720). He died
on the 8th of May 1721, the people of Paris throwing taunts and
stones at his coffin and accusing him of having ruined the kingdom.
In 1716 he had been created an honorary member of the Académie
des Sciences and, in 1718, a member of the French Academy.</p>

<p><span class="sc">René Louis de Voyer de Paulmy</span>, marquis d&rsquo;Argenson
(1694-1757), eldest son of the preceding, was a lawyer, and held
successively the posts of councillor at the parlement (1716),
<i>maître des requêtes</i> (1718), councillor of state (1719), and intendant
of justice, police and finance in Hainaut. During his five years&rsquo;
tenure of the last office he was mainly employed in provisioning
the troops, who were suffering from the economic confusion
resulting from Law&rsquo;s system. He returned to court in 1724
to exercise his functions as councillor of state. At that time
he had the reputation of being a conscientious man, but ill
adapted to intrigue, and was nicknamed &ldquo;la bête.&rdquo; He entered
into relations with the philosophers, and was won over to the
ideas of reform. He was the friend of Voltaire, who had been
a fellow-student of his at the Jesuit college Louis-le-grand, and
frequented the Club de l&rsquo;Entresol, the history of which he wrote
in his memoirs. It was then that he prepared his <i>Considérations
sur le gouvernement de la France</i>, which was published posthumously
by his son. He was also the friend and counsellor of
the minister G.L. de Chauvelin. In May 1744 he was appointed
member of the council of finance, and in November of the same
year the king chose him as secretary of state for foreign affairs,
his brother, the comte d&rsquo;Argenson (see below), being at the same
time secretary of state for war. France was at that time engaged
in the War of the Austrian Succession, and the government had
been placed by Louis XV. virtually in the hands of the two
brothers. The marquis d&rsquo;Argenson endeavoured to reform the
system of international relations. He dreamed of a &ldquo;European
Republic,&rdquo; and wished to establish arbitration between nations
in pursuance of the ideas of his friend the abbé de Saint-Pierre.
But he failed to realize any part of his projects. The generals
negotiated in opposition to his instructions; his colleagues
laid the blame on him; the intrigues of the courtiers passed
unnoticed by him; whilst the secret diplomacy of the king
neutralized his initiative. He concluded the marriage of the
dauphin to the daughter of Augustus III., king of Poland, but
was unable to prevent the election of the grand-duke of Tuscany
as emperor in 1745. On the both of January 1747 the king
thanked him for his services. He then retired into private life,
eschewed the court, associated with Voltaire, Condillac and
d&rsquo;Alembert, and spent his declining years in working at the
Academic des Inscriptions, of which he was appointed president
by the king in 1747, and revising his <i>Mémoires</i>. Voltaire, in
one of his letters, declared him to be &ldquo;the best citizen that had
ever tasted the ministry.&rdquo; He died on the 26th of January 1757.</p>

<p>He left a large number of manuscript works, of which his son,
Antoine René (1722-1787), known as the marquis de Paulmy,
published the <i>Considérations sur le gouvernement de France</i>
(Amsterdam, 1764) and <i>Essais dans le gout de ceux de Montaigne</i>
(<i>ib.</i> 1785). The latter, which contains many useful biographical
notes and portraits of his contemporaries, was republished in
1787 as <i>Loisirs d&rsquo;un ministre d&rsquo;état</i>. Argenson&rsquo;s most important
work, however, is his <i>Mémoires</i>, covering in great detail the
years 1725 to 1756, with an introductory part giving his recollections
since the year 1696. They are, as they were intended to be,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page459" id="page459"></a>459</span>
valuable &ldquo;materials for the history of his time.&rdquo; There are two
important editions, the first, with some letters, not elsewhere
published, by the marquis d&rsquo;Argenson, his great-grand-nephew
(5 vols., Paris, 1857 et seq.); the second, more correct, but less
complete, published by J.B. Rathery, for the Société de l&rsquo;Histoire
de France (9 vols., Paris, 1859 et seq.). The other works of the
marquis d&rsquo;Argenson, in MS., were destroyed in the fire at the
Louvre library in 1871.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Marc Pieere de Voyer de Paulmy</span>, comte d&rsquo;Argenson
(1696-1764), younger brother of the preceding, was born on the
16th of August 1696. Following the family tradition he studied
law and was councillor at the parlement of Paris. He succeeded
his father as lieutenant-general of police in Paris, but
held the post only five months (January 26 to June 30, 1720).
He then received the office of intendant of Tours, and resumed
the lieutenancy of police in 1722. On the 2nd of January 1724
he was appointed councillor of state. He gained the confidence
of the regent Orleans, administering his fortune and living with
his son till 1737. During this period he opened his salon to the
philosophers Chaulieu, la Fare and Voltaire, and collaborated
in the legislative labours of the chancellor d&rsquo;Aguesseau. In
March 1737 d&rsquo;Argenson was appointed director of the censorship
of books, in which post he showed sufficiently liberal views to
gain the approval of writers&mdash;a rare thing in the reign of Louis
XV. He only retained this post for a year. He became president
of the grand council (November 1738), intendant of the <i>généralité</i>
of Paris (August 1740), was admitted to the king&rsquo;s council
(August 1742), and in January 1743 was appointed secretary
of state for war in succession to the baron de Breteuil. As
minister for war he had a heavy task; the French armies
engaged in the War of the Austrian Succession were disorganized,
and the retreat from Prague had produced a disastrous effect.
After consulting with Marshal Saxe, he began the reform of the
new armies. To assist recruiting, he revived the old institution
of local militias, which, however, did not come up to his expectation.
In the spring of 1744 three armies were able to resume
the offensive in the Netherlands, Germany and Italy, and in
the following year France won the battle of Fontenoy, at which
d&rsquo;Argenson was present. After the peace in 1748 he occupied
himself with the important work of recasting the French army
on the model of the Prussian. He unified the types of cannon,
grouped the grenadiers into separate regiments, and founded
the École Militaire for the training of officers (1751). An edict
of the 1st of November 1751 granted patents of nobility to all
who had the rank of general officer. In addition to his duties
as minister of war he had the supervision of the printing, postal
administration and general administration of Paris. He was
responsible for the arrangement of the promenade of the Champs
Elysées and for the plan of the present Place de la Concorde.
He was exceedingly popular, and, although the court favourites
hated him, he had the support of the king. Nevertheless,
after the attempt of R.F. Damiens to assassinate the king,
Louis abandoned d&rsquo;Argenson to the machinations of the court
favourites and dismissed both him and his colleague, J.B. de
Machault d&rsquo;Arnouville (February 1757). D&rsquo;Argenson was exiled
to his estates at Les Ormes near Saumur, but he had previously
found posts for his brother, the marquis d&rsquo;Argenson, as minister
of foreign affairs, for his son Marc René as master of the
horse, and for his nephew Marc Antoine René as commissary
of war. From the time of his exile he lived in the society of
savants and philosophers. He had been elected member of the
Académie des Inscriptions in 1749. Diderot and d&rsquo;Alembert
dedicated the <i>Encyclopedie</i> to him, and Voltaire, C.J.F. Hénault,
and J.F. Marmontel openly visited him in his exile. After the
death of Madame de Pompadour he obtained permission to
return to Paris, and died a few days after his return, on the 22nd
of August 1764.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Marc Antoine René de Voyer</span>, marquis de Paulmy
d&rsquo;Argenson (1722-1787), nephew of the preceding and son of
René Louis, was born at Valenciennes on the 22nd of November
1722. Appointed councillor at the parlement (1744), and <i>maître
des requêtes</i> (1747), he was associated with his father in the
ministry of foreign affairs and with his uncle in the ministry of
war, and, in recognition of this experience, was commissioned
to inspect the troops and fortifications and sent on embassy
to Switzerland (1748). In 1751 his uncle recognized him as his
deputy and made over to him the reversion of the secretariate
of war. He then worked on the great reform of the army, and
after the dismissal of his uncle became minister of war (February
1757). But the outbreak of the Seven Years&rsquo; War made this post
exceedingly difficult to hold, and he resigned on the 23rd of
March 1758. He was ambassador to Poland from 1762 to 1764,
but failed to procure the nomination of the French candidate
to that throne. From 1766 to 1770 he was ambassador at Venice.
Failing to obtain the embassy at Rome, he retired at the age of
forty-eight and devoted the rest of his life to indulging his tastes
for history and biography. He brought together a large library,
very rich in French poetry and romance, and undertook various
publications with the help of his librarian. In 1775 he began
his <i>Bibliothèque universelle des romans</i>, of which forty volumes
appeared within three years, but subsequently handed over the
publication to other editors. His great work, <i>Mélanges tirês
d&rsquo;une grande bibliothèque</i>, was published in 65 volumes (Paris,
1779-1788). At his death he forbade his library to be dispersed:
it was bought by the comte d&rsquo;Artois (afterwards Charles X.) and
formed the nucleus of the present Bibliothèque de l&rsquo;Arsenal at
Paris (the marquis having been governor of the arsenal). He
died on the 13th of August 1787.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Marc René</span>, marquis de Voyer de Paulmy d&rsquo;Argenson
(1721-1782), known as the marquis de Voyer, son of Marc Pierre
de Voyer, the minister of war, was born in Paris on the 20th of
September 1721. He served in the army of Italy and the army
of Flanders in the War of the Austrian Succession, and was
<i>mestre de camp</i> (proprietary colonel) of the regiment of Berry
cavalry at the battle of Fontenoy (May 10, 1745), where he was
promoted brigadier. He was associated with his father in his
work of reorganizing the army, was made inspector of cavalry
and dragoons (1749), and succeeded his father as master of the
horse (1752). He introduced English horses into France. He
was lieutenant-general of Upper Alsace in 1753 and governor
of Vincennes in 1754, and served afterwards under Soubise in
the Seven Years&rsquo; War. He was wounded at Crefeld in 1758, and
was promoted lieutenant-general (1759). He followed his father
into exile at Les Ormes (1763), and in the last years of the reign
of Louis XV. sided with the malcontents headed by Choiseul;
but on the rupture with England he rejoined the service of the
king (1775). He was appointed inspector of the sea-board, and
put the roadstead of the island of Aix in a state of defence during
the American War of Independence. He caught marsh-fever
while attempting to drain the marshes of Rochefort, and died
at Les Ormes on the 18th of September 1782.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Marc René Marie de Voyer de Paulmy</span>, marquis d&rsquo;Argenson
(1771-1842), son of the preceding, was born in Paris in
September 1771. He was brought up by his father&rsquo;s cousin,
the marquis de Paulmy, governor of the arsenal, and was made
lieutenant of dragoons in 1789. Although, at the age of eighteen,
he had succeeded to several estates and a large fortune, he embraced
the revolutionary cause, joining the army of the North
as Lafayette&rsquo;s aide-de-camp and remaining with it even after
Lafayette&rsquo;s defection. Leaving France to take one of his sisters
to England, he was denounced on his return as a royalist conspirator,
on the charge of having in his possession portraits of
the royal family. He then went to live in Touraine, married
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page460" id="page460"></a>460</span>
the widow of Prince Victor de Broglie, and saved her and her
children from proscription. He introduced new agricultural
instruments and processes on his estates, and installed
machinery imported from England in his ironworks in Alsace.
He was an enthusiastic adherent of Napoleon, by whom he was
appointed in May 1809 prefect of Deux-Nèthes. He helped
to repel the English invasion of the islands of South Beveland
and Walcheren (August 1809), and afterwards directed the
defence works of Antwerp, but resigned this post (March 1813)
in consequence of the complaints of the inhabitants and the
exacting demands of the emperor. In May 1814 he refused the
prefecture of Marseilles offered to him by the Bourbons, but
was elected deputy from Belfort in 1815 during the Hundred
Days. On the 5th of July 1815 he took part in the declaration
protesting against any tampering with the immutable rights of
the nation. He was a member of the <i>Chambre introuvable</i>, where
he became one of the orators of the democratic party. He was
one of the founders of the journal <i>Le censeur européen</i> and of
the <i>Club de la liberté de la presse</i>, and was an uncompromising
opponent of reaction. Not re-elected in 1824 on account of his
liberal ideas, he returned to the chamber under the Martignac
ministry (1828), and resolutely persisted in his championship
of the liberty of the press and of public worship. On the death
of his wife he voluntarily renounced his mandate (July 1829),
and hailed the revolution of 1830 with great satisfaction. On
the 3rd of November 1830 he was elected to the chamber as
deputy from Châtellerault, and took the oath, adding, however,
the reservation &ldquo;subject to the progress of the public reason.&rdquo;
His independent attitude resulted in his defeat in the following
year at the Châtellerault election, but he was returned for
Strassburg. He wished the incidence of the taxes to be arranged
according to social condition, and advocated a single tax proportionate
to income like the English income tax. He harped
incessantly on this idea in his speeches and articles (see his letters
in <i>La Tribune</i> of June 20, 1832). Although he was a proprietor
of ironworks he opposed the protectionist laws, which he considered
injurious to the workmen. He became the mouthpiece
of the advanced ideas; subsidized the opposition newspapers,
especially the <i>National</i>; received into his house F.M. Buonarroti,
who in 1796 had been implicated in the conspiracy of
&ldquo;Gracchus&rdquo; Babeuf (<i>q.v.</i>); and became a member of the
committee of the Society of the Rights of Man. He was even
sued in the courts for a pamphlet called <i>Boutade d&rsquo;un homme
riche à sentiments populaires</i>, and delivered a speech to the
jury in which he displayed very daring social theories. But
he gradually grew discouraged and retired from public affairs,
refusing even municipal office, and living in seclusion at La
Grange in the forest of Guerche, where he devoted his inventive
faculty to devising agricultural improvements. He subsequently
returned to Paris, where he died on the 1st of August 1842.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Charles Marc René de Voyer</span>, marquis d&rsquo;Argenson
(1796-1862), son of the preceding, was born at Boulogne-sur-Spine
on the 20th of April 1796. He concerned himself little
with politics. He was, however, a member of the council-general
of Vienne for six years, but was expelled from it in 1840
in consequence of his advanced ideas and his relations with the
Opposition. In 1848 he was elected deputy from Vienne to the
Constituent Assembly by 12,000 votes. He was an active
member of the Archaeological Society of Touraine and the
Society of Antiquaries of the West, and wrote learned works
for these bodies. He collaborated in preparing the archives
of the scientific congress at Tours in 1847; brought out two
editions of the MSS. of his great-grand-uncle, the minister of
foreign affairs under Louis XV., under the title <i>Mémoires du
marquis d&rsquo;Argenson</i>, one in 1825, and the other, in 5 vols., in 1857-1858;
and published <i>Discours et opinions de mon père, M. Voyer
d&rsquo;Argenson</i> (2 vols., 1845). He died on the 31st of July,1862.</p>

5072. It is situated on the slope of a hill on the right bank of the
Orne at its confluence with the Ure. The town has remains of
old fortifications, among them the Tour Marguerite, and a
château, now used as a law-court, dating from the 15th century.
The church of St Germain (15th, 16th and 17th centuries) has
several features of architectural beauty, notably the sculptured
northern portal, and the central and western towers. The
church of St Martin, dating from the 15th century, has good
stained glass. The handsome modern town-hall contains among
other institutions the tribunal of commerce, the museum and
the library. Argentan is the seat of a sub-prefect, has a tribunal
of first instance and a communal college. Leather-working and
the manufacture of stained glass are leading industries. There are
quarries of limestone in the vicinity. Argentan was a viscounty
from the 11th century onwards; it was often taken and pillaged.
During the Religious Wars it remained attached to the Catholic
party. François Eudes de Mézeray, the historian, was born near
the town, and a monument has been erected to his memory.</p>

<p><span class="bold">ARGENTINA,<a name="ar43" id="ar43"></a></span> or the <span class="sc">Argentine Republic</span> (officially, <i>Republica
Argentina</i>), a country occupying the greater part of the
southern extremity of South America. It is of wedge shape,
extending from 21° 55&prime; S. to the most southerly point of the
island of Tierra del Fuego in 55° 2&prime; 30&Prime; S., while its extremes of
longitude are 53° 40&prime; on the Brazilian frontier and 73° 17&prime; 30&Prime; W.
on the Chilean frontier. Its length from north to south is 2285
statute miles, and its greatest width about 930 m. It is the
second largest political division of the continent, having an area of
1,083,596 sq. m. (Gotha measurement). It is bounded N. by
Bolivia and Paraguay, E. by Paraguay, Brazil, Uruguay and the
Atlantic, W. by Chile, and S. by the converging lines of the
Atlantic and Chile.</p>

<p><i>Boundaries</i>.&mdash;At different times Argentina has been engaged
in disputes over boundary lines with every one of her neighbours,
that with Chile being only settled in 1902. Beginning at the
estuary of the Rio de la Plata, the boundary line ascends the
Uruguay river, on the eastern side of the strategically important
island of Martin García, to the mouth of the Pequiry, thence
under the award of President Grover Cleveland in 1894 up that
small river to its source and in a direct line to the source of the
Santo Antonio, a small tributary of the Iguassú, thence down
the Santo Antonio and Iguassú to the upper Paraná, which forms
the southern boundary of Paraguay. From the confluence of the
upper Paraná and Paraguay the line ascends the latter to the
mouth of the Pilcomayo, which river, under the award of President
R.B. Hayes in 1878, forms the boundary between Argentina
and Paraguay from the Paraguay river north-west to the
Bolivian frontier. In accordance with the Argentine-Bolivian
treaty of 1889 the boundary line between these republics continues
up the Pilcomayo to the 22nd parallel, thence west to the
Tarija river, which it follows down to the Bermejo, thence up
the latter to its source, and westerly through the Quiaca ravine
and across to a point on the San Juan river opposite Esmoraca.
From this point it ascends the San Juan south and west to the
Cerro de Granadas, and thence south-west to Cerro Incahuasi
and Cerro Zapalegui on the Chilean frontier. The boundary
with Chile, extending across more than 32° lat., had been
the cause of disputes for many years, which at times led to
costly preparations for war. The debts of the two nations
resulted largely from this one cause. In 1881 a treaty was
signed which provided that the boundary line should follow
the highest crests of the Andes forming the watershed as far
south as the 52nd parallel, thence east to the 70th meridian and
south-east to Cape Dungeness at the eastern entrance to the
Straits of Magellan. Crossing the Straits the line should follow
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page461" id="page461"></a>461</span>
the meridian of 68° 44&prime;, south to Beagle Channel, and thence east to
the Atlantic, giving Argentina the eastern part of the Tierra del
Fuego and Staten Island. By this agreement Argentina was
confirmed in the possession of the greater part of Patagonia,
while Chile gained control of the Straits of Magellan, much
adjacent territory on the north, the larger part of Tierra del
Fuego and all the neighbouring islands south and west.</p>

<p>When the attempt was made to mark this boundary the
commissioners were unable to agree on a line across the Puna de
Atacama in the north, where parallel ranges enclosing a high arid
plateau without any clearly defined drainage to the Atlantic or
Pacific, gave an opportunity for conflicting claims. In the south
the broken character of the Cordillera, pierced in places by large
rivers flowing into the Pacific and having their upper drainage
basins on the eastern side of the line of highest crests, gave rise to
unforeseen and very difficult questions. Finally, under a convention
of the 17th of April 1896, these conflicting claims were
submitted to arbitration. In 1899 a mixed commission with
Hon. W.I. Buchanan, United States minister at Buenos Aires,
serving as arbitrator, reached a decision on the Atacama line
north of 26° 52&prime; 45&Prime; S. lat., which was a compromise though it
gave the greater part of the territory to Argentina. The line
starts at the intersection of the 23rd parallel with the 67th
meridian and runs south-westerly and southerly to the
mountain and volcano summits of Rincón, Socompa, Llullaillaco,
Azufre, Aguas Blancas and Sierra Nevada, thence to the
initial point of the British award. (See <i>Geogr. Jour.</i>, 1899, xiv.
322-323.) The line south of 26° 52&prime; 45&Prime; S. lat. had been located by
the commissioners of the two republics with the exception of
four sections. These were referred to the arbitration of Queen
Victoria, and, after a careful survey under the direction of Sir
Thomas H. Holdich, the award was rendered by King Edward
VII. in 1902. (See <i>Geogr. Jour.</i>, 1903, xxi. 45-50.) In the first
section the line starts from a pillar erected in the San Francisco
pass, about 26° 50&prime; S. lat., and follows the water-parting southward
to the highest peak of the Tres Cruces mountains in
27° 0&prime; 45&Prime; S. lat., 68° 49&prime; 5&Prime; W. long. In the second, the line runs
from 40° 2&prime; S. lat., 71° 40&prime; 36&Prime; W. long., along the water-parting to
the southern termination of the Cerro Perihueico in the valley
of the Huahum river, thence across that river, 71° 40&prime; 36&Prime; W.
long., and along the water-parting around the upper basin of the
Huahum to a junction with the line previously determined. In
the third and longest section, the line starts from a pillar erected
in the Perez Rosales pass, near Lake Nahuel-Huapi, and follows
the water-parting southward to the highest point of Mt. Tronador,
and thence in a very tortuous course along local water-partings
and across the Chilean rivers Manso, Puelo, Fetaleufu, Palena,
Pico and Aisen, and the lakes Buenos Aires, Pueyrredón and San
Martin, to avoid the inclusion of Argentine settlements within
Chilean territory, to the Cerro Fitzroy and continental water-parting
north-west of Lake Viedma, between 49° and 50° S. lat.
The northern half of this line does not run far from the 72nd
meridian, except in 44° 30&prime; S. where it turns eastward nearly a
degree to include the upper valley of the Frias river in Chilean
territory, but south of the 49th parallel it curves westward to
give Argentina sole possession of lakes Viedma and Argentino.
The fourth section, which was made particularly difficult of
solution by the extension inland of the Pacific coast inlets and
sounds and by the Chilean colonies located there, was adjusted
by running the line eastward from the point of divergence in
50° 50&prime; S. lat. along the Sierra Baguales, thence south and south-east
to the 52nd parallel, crossing several streams and following
the crests of the Cerro Cazador. The Chilean settlement of
Ultima Esperanza (Last Hope), over which there had been much
controversy, remains under Chilean jurisdiction.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p><i>Physical Geography</i>.&mdash;For purposes of surface description, Argentina
may be divided primarily into three great divisions&mdash;the
mountainous zone and tablelands of the west, extending the full
length of the republic; the great plains of the east, extending from
the Pilcomayo to the Rio Negro; and the desolate, arid steppes of
Patagonia. The first covers from one-third to one-fourth of the
width of the country between the Bolivian frontier and the Rio
Negro, and comprises the elevated Cordilleras and their plateaus,
with flanking ranges and spurs toward the east. In the extreme
north, extending southward from the great Bolivian highlands,
there are several parallel ranges, the most prominent of which are:
the Sierra de Santa Catalina, from which the detached Cachi,
Gulumpaji and Famatina ranges project southward; and the Sierra
de Santa Victoria, south of which are the Zenta, Aconquija, Ambato
and Ancaste ranges. These minor ranges, excepting the Zenta, are
separated from the Andean masses by comparatively low depressions
and are usually described as distinct ranges; topographically, however,
they seem to form a continuation of the ranges running southward
from the Santa Victoria and forming the eastern rampart of
the great central plateau of which the Puna de Atacama covers a
large part. The elevated plateaus between these ranges are semi-arid
and inhospitable, and are covered with extensive saline basins,
which become lagoons in the wet season and morasses or dry salt-pans
in the dry season. These saline basins extend down to the
lower terraces of Córdoba, Mendoza and La Pampa. Flanking this
great widening of the Andes on the south-east are the three short
parallel ranges of Córdoba, belonging to another and older formation.
North of them is the great saline depression, known as the &ldquo;salinas
grandes,&rdquo; 643 ft. above sea-level, where it is crossed by a railway;
north-east is another extensive saline basin enclosing the &ldquo;Mar
Chiquita&rdquo; (of Córdoba) and the morasses into which the waters of
the Rio Saladillo disappear; and on the north are the more elevated
plains, partly saline, of western Córdoba, which separate this isolated
group of mountains from the Andean spurs of Rioja and San Luis.
The eastern ranges parallel to the Andes are here broken into detached
extensions and spurs, which soon disappear in the elevated western
pampas, and the Andes contract south of Aconcagua to a single
range, which descends gradually to the great plains of La Pampa
and Neuquen. The lower terrace of this great mountainous region,
with elevations ranging from 1000 to 1500 ft., is in reality the western
margin of the great Argentine plain, and may be traced from Oran
(1017 ft.) near the Bolivian frontier southward through Tucumán
(1476 ft.), Frias (1129 ft.), Córdoba (1279 ft.), Rio Cuarto (1358 ft.),
Paunero (1250 ft.), and thence westward and southward through
still unsettled regions to the Rio Negro at the confluence of the
Neuquen and Limay.</p>

<p>The Argentine part of the great La Plata plain extends from the
Pilcomayo south to the Rio Negro, and from the lower terraces of
the Andes eastward to the Uruguay and Atlantic. In the north
the plain is known as the Gran Chaco, and includes the country
between the Pilcomayo and Salado del Norte and an extensive
depression immediately north of the latter river, believed to be the
undisturbed bottom of the ancient Pampean sea. The northern
part of the Gran Chaco is partly wooded and swampy, and as the
slope eastward is very gentle and the rivers much obstructed by
sand bars, floating trees and vegetation, large areas are regularly
flooded during rainy seasons. South of the Bermejo the land is
more elevated and drier, though large depressions covered with
marshy lagoons are to be found, similar to those farther north.
The forests here are heavier. Still farther south and south-west
there are open grassy plains and large areas covered with salt-pans.
The general elevation of the Chaco varies from 600 to 800 ft. above
sea-level. The Argentine &ldquo;mesopotamia,&rdquo; between the Paraná and
Uruguay rivers, belongs in great measure to this same region, being
partly wooded, flat and swampy in the north (Corrientes), but
higher and undulating in the south (Entre Rios). The Misiones
territory of the extreme north-east belongs to the older highlands
of Brazil, is densely wooded, and has ranges of hills sometimes rising
to a height of 1000 to 1300 ft.</p>

<p>The remainder of the great Argentine plain is the treeless, grassy
<i>pampa</i> (Quichua for &ldquo;level spaces&rdquo;), apparently a dead level, but
in reality rising gradually from the Atlantic westward toward the
Andes. Evidence of this is to be found in the altitudes of the
stations on the Buenos Aires and Pacific railway running a little
north of west across the pampas to Mendoza. The average elevation
of Buenos Aires is about 65 ft.; of Mercedes, 70 m. westward,
132 ft.; of Junín (160 m.), 267 ft.; and of Paunero (400 m.) it is
1250 ft., showing an average rise of about 3 ft. in a mile. The
apparently uniform level of the pampas is much broken along its
southern margin by the Tandil and Ventana sierras, and by ranges
of hills and low mountains in the southern and western parts of the
territory of La Pampa. Extensive depressions also are found, some
of which are subject to inundations, as along the lower Salado in
Buenos Aires and along the lower courses of the Colorado and Negro.
In the extreme west, which is as yet but slightly explored and settled,
there is an extensive depressed area, largely saline in character,
which drains into lakes and morasses, having no outlet to the ocean.
The rainfall is under 6 in. annually, but the drainage from the
eastern slopes of the Andes is large enough to meet the loss from
evaporation and keep these inland lakes from drying up. At an
early period this depressed area drained southward to the Colorado,
and the bed of the old outlet can still be traced. The rivers belonging
to this inland drainage system are the Vermejo, San Juan and
Desaguadero, with their affluents, and their southward flow can be
traced from about 28° S. lat. to the great lagoons and morasses
between 36° and 37° S. lat. in the western part of La Pampa territory.
Some of the principal affluents are the Vinchina and Jachal, or
Zanjon, which flow into the Vermejo, the Patos, which flows into
the San Juan, and the Mendoza, Tunuyan and Diamante which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page462" id="page462"></a>462</span>
flow into the Desaguadero, all of these being Andean snow-fed
rivers. The Desaguadero also receives the outflow of the Laguna
Bebedero, an intensely saline lake of western San Luis. The lower
course of the Desaguadero is known as the Salado because of the
brackish character of its water. Another considerable river flowing
into the same great morass is the Atuel, which rises in the Andes
not far south of the Diamante. (A description of the Patagonian
part of Argentina will be found under <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Patagonia</a></span>.)</p>

<p><i>Rivers and Lakes</i>.&mdash;The hydrography of Argentina is of the
simplest character. The three great rivers that form the La Plata
system&mdash;the Paraguay, Paraná and Uruguay&mdash;have their sources
in the highlands of Brazil and flow southward through a great
continental depression, two of them forming eastern boundary lines,
and one of them, the Paraná, flowing across the eastern part of the
republic. The northern part of Argentina, therefore, drains eastward
from the mountains to these rivers, except where some great inland
depression gives rise to a drainage having no outlet to the sea, and
except, also, in the &ldquo;mesopotamia&rdquo; region, where small streams
flow westward into the Paraná and eastward into the Uruguay.
The largest of the rivers through which Argentina drains into the
Plata system are the Pilcomayo, which rises in Bolivia and flows
south-east along the Argentine frontier for about 400 m.; the
Bermejo, which rises on the northern frontier and flows south-east
into the Paraguay; and the Salado del Norte (called Rio del Jura-mento
in its upper course), which rises on the high mountain slopes
of western Salta and flows south-east into the Paraná. Another
river of this class is the Carcarañal, about 300 m. long, formed by
the confluence of the Tercero and Cuarto, whose sources are in the
Sierra de Córdoba; it flows eastward across the pampas, and discharges
into the Paraná at Gaboto, about 40 m. above Rosario.
Other small rivers rising in the Córdoba sierras are the Primero and
Segundo, which flow into the lagoons of north-east Córdoba, and the
Quinto, which flows south-easterly into the lagoons and morasses
of southern Córdoba. The Luján rises near Mercedes, province of
Buenos Aires, is about 150 m. long, and flows north-easterly into
the Paraná delta. Many smaller streams discharge into the Paraguay
and Paraná from the west, some of them wholly dependent upon the
rains, and drying up during long droughts. The Argentine &ldquo;mesopotamia&rdquo;
is well watered by a large number of small streams flowing
north and west into the Paraná, and east into the Uruguay. The
largest of these are the Corrientes, Feliciano and Gualeguay of the
western slope, and the Aguapey and Miriñay of the eastern. None
of the tributaries of the La Plata system thus far mentioned is
navigable except the lower Pilcomayo and Bermejo for a few miles.
These Chaco rivers are obstructed by sand bars and snags, which
could be removed only by an expenditure of money unwarranted
by the present population and traffic. In the southern pampa
region there are many small streams, flowing into the La Plata
estuary and the Atlantic; most of these are unknown by name
outside the republic. The largest and only important river is the
Salado del Sud, which rises in the north-west corner of the province
of Buenos Aires and flows south-east for a distance of 360 m. into
the bay of Samborombon. On the southern margin of the pampas
are the Colorado and Negro, both large, navigable rivers flowing
entirely across the republic from the Andes to the Atlantic. Many
of the rivers of Argentina, as implied by their names (Salado and
Saladillo), are saline or brackish in character, and are of slight use
in the pastoral and agricultural industries of the country. The lakes
of Argentina are exceptionally numerous, although comparatively
few are large enough to merit a name on the ordinary general map.
They vary from shallow, saline lagoons in the north-western plateaus,
to great, picturesque, snow-fed lakes in the Andean foothills of
Patagonia. The province of Buenos Aires has more than 600 lakes,
the great majority small, and some brackish. The La Pampa
territory also is dotted with small lakes. The Bebedero, in San
Luis, and Porongos, in Córdoba, and others, are shallow, saline lakes
which receive the drainage of a considerable area and have no outlet.
The large saline Mar Chiquita, of Córdoba, is fed from the Sierra de
Córdoba and has no outlet. In the northern part of Gorrientes
there is a large area of swamps and shallow lagoons which are
believed to be slowly drying up.</p>

<p><i>Harbours</i>.&mdash;Although having a great extent of coast-line, Argentina
has but few really good harbours. The two most frequented
by ocean-going vessels are Buenos Aires and Ensenada (La Plata),
both of which have been constructed at great expense to overcome
natural disadvantages. Perhaps the best natural harbour of the
republic is that of Bahia Blanca, a large bay of good depth, sheltered
by islands, and 534 m. by sea south of Buenos Aires; here the
government is building a naval station and port called Puerto
Militar or Puerto Belgrano, and little dredging is needed to render
the harbour accessible to the largest ocean-going vessels. About
100 m. south of Bahia Blanca is the sheltered bay of San Bias,
which may become of commercial importance, and between the
42nd and 43rd parallels are the land-locked bays of San José
and Nueva (Golfo Nuevo)&mdash;the first as yet unused; on the latter
is Puerto Madryn, 838 m. from Buenos Aires, the outlet for
the Welsh colony of Chubut. Other small harbours on the lower
Patagonian coast are not prominent, owing to lack of population.
An occasional Argentine steamer visits these ports in the interests
of colonists. The beet-known among them are Puerto Deseado
(Port Desire) at the mouth of the Deseado river (1253 m.), Santa
Cruz, at the mouth of the Santa Cruz river (1481 m.), and Ushuaia,
on Beagle Channel, Tierra del Fuego. North of Buenos Aires, on
the Paraná river, is the port of Rosario, the outlet for a rich agricultural
district, ranking next to the federal capital in importance.
Other river ports, of less importance, are Concordia on the Uruguay
river, San Nicolás and Campana on the Paraná river, Santa Fé on
the Salado, a few miles from the Paraná, the city of Paraná on the
Paraná river, and Gualeguay on the Gualeguay river.</p>

<p><i>Geology</i>.&mdash;The Pampas of Argentina are generally covered by
loess. The Cordillera, which bounds them on the west, is formed of
folded beds, while the Sierras which rise in their midst, consist mainly
of gneiss, granite and schist. In the western Sierras, which are
more or less closely attached to the main chain of the Cordillera,
Cambrian and Silurian fossils have been found at several places.
These older beds are overlaid, especially in the western part of the
country, by a sandstone series which contains thin seams of coal
and many remains of plants. At Bajo de Velis, in San Luis, the
plants belong to the &ldquo;Glossopteris flora,&rdquo; which is so widely spread
in South Africa, India and Australia, and the beds are correlated
with the Karharbári series of India (Permian or Permo-Carboni-ferous).
Elsewhere the plants generally indicate a higher horizon
and are considered to correspond with the Rhaetic of Europe.
Jurassic beds are known only in the Cordillera itself, and the Cretaceous
beds, which occur in the west of the country, are of fresh-water
origin. As far west, therefore, as the Cordillera, there is no evidence
that any part of the region was ever beneath the sea in Mesozoic
times, and the plant-remains indicate a land connexion with Africa.
This view is supported by Neumayr&rsquo;s comparison of Jurassic faunas
throughout the world. The Lower Tertiary consists largely of
reddish sandstones resting upon the old rocks of the Cordillera and
of the Sierras. Towards the east they lie at a lower level; but in
the Andes they reach a height of nearly 10,000 ft., and are strongly
folded, showing that the elevation of the chain was not completed
until after their deposition. The marine facies of the later Tertiaries
is confined to the neighbourhood of the coast, and was probably
formed after the elevation of the Andes; but inland, fresh-water
deposits of this period are met with, especially in Patagonia. Contemporaneous
volcanic rocks are associated with the Ordovician
beds and with the Rhaetic sandstones in several places. During the
Tertiary period the great volcanoes of the Andes were formed, and
there were smaller eruptions in the Sierras. The principal rocks are
andesites, but trachytes and basalts are also common. Great masses
of granite, syenite and diorite were intruded at this period, and send
tongues even into the andesitic tuffs.</p>

<p>Silver, gold, lead and copper ores occur in many localities.
They are found chiefly in the neighbourhood of the eruptive masses
of the hilly regions. (See also <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Andes</a></span>.)<a name="fa1b" id="fa1b" href="#ft1b"><span class="sp">1</span></a></p>

<p><i>Climate</i>.&mdash;The great extent of Argentina in latitude&mdash;about 33°&mdash;and
its range in altitude from sea-level westward to the permanently
snow-covered peaks of the Andes, give it a highly diversified climate,
which is further modified by prevailing winds and mountain barriers.
The temperature and rainfall are governed by conditions different
from those in corresponding latitudes of the northern hemisphere.
Southern Patagonia and Tierra del Fuego, for instance, although
they correspond in latitude to Labrador, are made habitable and an
excellent sheep-grazing country by the southerly equatorial current
along the continental coast. The climate, however, is colder than
the corresponding latitudes of western Europe, because of the prevailing
westerly winds, chilled in crossing the Andes. In the extreme
north-west an elevated region, whose aridity is caused by the
&ldquo;blanketing&rdquo; influence of the eastern Andean ranges, extends
southward to Mendoza. The northern part of the republic, east
of the mountains, is subject to the oscillatory movements of the
south-east trade winds, which cause a division of the year into wet
and dry seasons. Farther south, in Patagonia, the prevailing wind
is westerly, in which case the Andes again &ldquo;blanket&rdquo; an extensive
region and deprive it of rain, turning it into an arid desolate steppe.
Below this region, where the Andean barrier is low and broken, the
moist westerly winds sweep over the land freely and give it a large
rainfall, good pastures and a vigorous forest growth. If the republic
be divided into sections by east and west lines, diversities of climate
in the same latitude appear. In the extreme north a little over a
degree and a half of territory lies within the torrid zone, extending
from the Pilcomayo about 500 m. westward to the Chilean frontier;
its eastern end is in the low, wooded plain of the Gran Chaco, where
the mean annual temperature is 73° F., and the annual rainfall is
63 in.; but on the arid, elevated plateau at its western extremity
the temperature falls below 57° F., and the rainfall has diminished
to 2 in. The character of the soil changes from the alluvial lowlands
of the Gran Chaco, covered with forests of palms and other tropical
vegetation, to the sandy, saline wastes of the Puna de Atacama,
almost barren of vegetation and overshadowed by permanently
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page463" id="page463"></a>463</span>
snow-crowned peaks. Between the 30th and 31st parallels, a region
essentially sub-tropical in character, the temperature ranges from
66° on the eastern plains to 62-5° in Córdoba and 64° F. on the
higher, arid, sun-parched tablelands of San Juan. The rainfall,
which varies between 39 and 47 in. in Entre Rios, decreases to 27 in.
in Córdoba and 2 in. in San Juan. The republic has a width of about
745 m. at this point, three-fourths of which is a comparatively level
alluvial plain, and the remainder an arid plateau broken by mountain
ranges. In the vicinity of Buenos Aires the climatic conditions vary
very little from those of the pampa region; the mean annual temperature
is about 63° (maximum 104°; minimum 32°), and the annual
rainfall is 34 in.; snow is rarely seen. South of the pampa region,
on the 40th parallel, the mean temperature varies only slightly
in the 370 m. from the mouth of the Colorado to the Andes, ranging
from 57° to 55°; but the rainfall increases from 8 in. on the coast
to 16 in. on the east slope of the Cordillera. This section is near the
northern border of the arid Patagonian steppes. In Tierra del
Fuego (lat. 53° to 55°), the climatic conditions are in strong contrast
to those of the north. Here the mean temperature is between 46°
and 48° in summer and 36° and 38° in winter, rains are frequent,
and snow falls every month in the year. The central and southern
parts of the island and the neighbouring Staten Island are exceptionally
rainy, the latter having 251½ rainy days in the year. The
precipitation of rain, snow and hail is about 55 in.</p>

<p class="pt2">The prevailing winds through this southern region are westerly,
being moist below the 52nd parallel, and dry between it and the
40th parallel. In the north and on the pampas the north wind is
hot and depressing, while the south wind is cool and refreshing.
The north wind usually terminates with a thunderstorm or with a
<i>pampero</i>, a cold south-west wind from the Andes which blows with
great violence, causes a fall in temperature of 15° to 20°, and is most
frequent from June to November&mdash;the southern winter and spring.
In the Andean region, a dry, hot wind from the north or north-west,
called the <i>Zonda</i>, blows with great intensity, especially in September-October,
and causes much discomfort and suffering. It is followed
by a cold south wind which often lowers the temperature 25°. The
climate of the pampas is temperate and healthy, and is admirably
suited to agricultural and pastoral pursuits. Its greatest defect is
the cold southerly and westerly storms, which cause great losses in
cattle and sheep. The Patagonian coast-line and mountainous region
are also healthy, having a dry and bracing climate. In the north, however,
the hot lowlands are malarial and unsuited to north European
settlement, while the dry, elevated plateaus are celebrated for their
healthiness, those of Catamarca having an excellent reputation as a
sanatorium for sufferers from pulmonary and bronchial diseases.</p>

<p><i>Flora</i>.&mdash;The flora of Argentina should be studied according to
natural zones corresponding to the physical divisions of the country&mdash;the
rich tropical and sub-tropical regions of the north, the treeless
pampas of the centre, the desert steppes of the south, and the arid
plateaus of the north-west. The vegetation of each region has its
distinctive character, modified here and there by elevation, irrigation
from mountain streams, and by the saline character of the soil.
In the extreme south, where an Arctic vegetation is found, the
pastures are rich, and the forests, largely of the Antarctic beech
(<i>Fagus antarctica</i>), are vigorous wherever the rainfall is heavy.
The greater part of Patagonia is comparatively barren and has no
arboreal growth, except in the well-watered valleys of the Andean
foothills. The water-courses and depressions of the shingly steppts
afford pasturage sufficient for the guanaco, and in places support a
thorny vegetation of low growth and starved appearance. The
Antarctic beech and Winter&rsquo;s bark (<i>Drimys Winteri</i>) are found at
intervals along the Andes to the northern limits of this zone. The
pampas, which cover so large a part of the republic, have no native
trees whatever, and no woods except the scrubby growth of the delta
islands of the Paraná, and a fringe of low thorn-bushes along the
Atlantic coast south to Mar Chiquita and south of the Tandil sierra,
which, strictly speaking, does not belong to this region. The great
plains are covered with edible grasses, divided into two classes,
<i>pasto duro</i> (hard grass) and <i>pasto blando</i>, or <i>tierno</i> (soft grass)&mdash;the
former tall, coarse, nutritious and suitable for horses and cattle,
and the latter tender grasses and herbs, including clovers, suitable
for sheep and cattle. The so-called &ldquo;pampas-grass&rdquo; (<i>Gynerium
argenteum</i>) is not found at all on the dry lands, but in the wet grounds
of the south and south-west. The <i>pasto duro</i> is largely composed
of the genera <i>Stipa</i> and <i>Melica</i>. In the dry, saline regions of the
west and north-west, where the rainfall is slight, there are large
thickets of low-growing, thorny bushes, poor in foliage. The predominating
species is the chañar (<i>Gurliaca decorticans</i>), which produces
an edible berry, and occurs from the Rio Negro to the northern
limits of the republic. Huge cacti are also characteristic of this
region. On the lower slopes of the Andes are found oak, beech,
cedar, Winter&rsquo;s bark, pine (<i>Araucaria imbricata</i>), laurel and calden
(<i>Prosopis algarobilla</i>). The provinces of Santa Fé, Córdoba and
Santiago del Estero are only partially wooded; large areas of plains
are intermingled with scrubby forests of algarrobo (<i>Prosopis</i>),
quebracho-blanco (<i>Aspido-sperma quebracho</i>), tala (<i>Celtis tola</i>,
<i>Sellowiana</i>, <i>acuminata</i>), acacias and other genera. In Tucumán
and eastern Salta the same division into forests and open plains
exists, but the former are of denser growth and contain walnut,
cedar, laurel, tipa (<i>Machaerium fertile</i>) and quebracho-colorado
(<i>Loxopterygium Lorentzii</i>). The territories of the Gran Chaco,
however, are covered with a characteristic tropical vegetation, in
which the palm predominates, but intermingled south of the Bermejo
with heavy growths of algarrobo, quebracho-colorado, urunday
(<i>Astronium fraxinifolium</i>), lapacho (<i>Tecoma curialis</i>) and palosanto
(<i>Cuayacum officinalis</i>), all esteemed for hardness and fineness of
grain. Other palms abound, such as the pindo (<i>Cocos australis</i>),
mbocaya (<i>Cocos sclerocarpa</i>) and the yatai (<i>Cocos yatai</i>), but the
predominating species north of the Bermejo is the caranday or
Brazilian wax-palm (<i>Copernicia cerifera</i>), which has varied uses.
The forest habit in this region is close association of species, and
there are &ldquo;palmares,&rdquo; &ldquo;algarrobales,&rdquo; &ldquo;chañarales,&rdquo; &amp;c,, and
among these open pasture lands, giving to a distant landscape a
park-like appearance. In the &ldquo;mesopotamia&rdquo; region the flora is
similar to that of the southern Chaco, but in the Misiones it approximates
more to that of the neighbouring Brazilian highlands. Among
the marvellous changes wrought in Argentina by the advent of
European civilization, is the creation of a new flora by the introduction
of useful trees and plants from every part of the world.
Indian corn, quinoa, mandioca, possibly the potato, cotton and
various fruits, including the strawberry, were already known to
the aborigines, but with the conqueror came wheat, barley, oats,
flax, many kinds of vegetables, apples, peaches, apricots, pears,
grapes, figs, oranges and lemons, together with alfalfa and new
grasses for the plains. The Australian eucalyptus is now grown
in many places, and there are groves of the paradise or paraiso tree
(<i>Melia azedarach</i>) on the formerly treeless pampa. The cereals of
Europe are a source of increasing wealth to the nation, and alfalfa
promises new prosperity for pastoral industries.</p>

<p><i>Fauna</i>.&mdash;The Argentine fauna, like its flora, has been greatly
influenced by the character and position of the pampas. Whatever
it may have been in remote geological periods, it is now extremely
limited both in size and numbers. Of the indigenous fauna, the
tapir of the north and the guanaco of the west and south are the
largest of the animals. The pampas were almost destitute of animal
life before the horses and cattle of the Spanish invaders were there
turned out to graze, and the puma and jaguar never came there until
the herds of European cattle attracted them. The timid viscacha
(<i>Lagostomus trichodactylus</i>), living in colonies, often with the burrowing
owl, and digging deep under ground like the American prairie
dog, was almost the only quadruped to be seen upon these immense
open plains. The fox, of which several species exist, probably never
ventured far into the plain, for it afforded him no shelter. Immense
flocks of gulls were probably attracted to it then as now by its insect
life, and its lagoons and streams teemed with aquatic birds. The
occupation of this region by Europeans, and the introduction of
horses, asses, cattle, sheep, goats and swine, have completely changed
its aspect and character. On the Patagonian steppes there are
comparatively few species of animals. Among them are the puma
(<i>Felis concolor</i>), a smaller variety of the jaguar (<i>Felis onça</i>), the
wolf, the fox, the Patagonian hare (<i>Dolichotis patagonica</i>) and two
species of wild cat. The huge glyptodon once inhabited this region,
which now possesses the smallest armadillo known, the &ldquo;quir-quincho&rdquo;
or <i>Dasypus minutus</i>. The guanaco (<i>Auchenia</i>), which
ranges from Tierra del Fuego to the Bolivian highlands, finds comparative
safety in these uninhabitable solitudes, and is still numerous.
The &ldquo;ñandú&rdquo; or American ostrich (<i>Rhea americana</i>), inhabiting the
pampas and open plains of the Chaco, has in Patagonia a smaller
counterpart (<i>Rhea Darwinii</i>), which is never seen north of the Rio
Negro. On the arid plateaus of the north-west, the guanaco and
vicuña are still to be found, though less frequently, together with a
smaller species of viscacha (<i>Lagidium cuvieri</i>). The greatest development
of the Argentine fauna, however, is in the warm, wooded
regions of the north and north-east, where many animals are of the
same species as those in the neighbouring territories of Brazil.
Several species of monkeys inhabit the forests from the Paraná to
the Bolivian frontier. Pumas, jaguars and one or two species of
wild cat are numerous, as also the Argentine wolf and two of three
species of fox. The coatí, marten, skunk and otter (<i>Lutra paranensis</i>)
are widely distributed. Three species of deer are common.
In the Chaco the tapir or anta (<i>Tapir americanus</i>) still finds a safe
retreat, and the peccary (<i>Dycotyles torquatus</i>) ranges from Córdoba
north to the Bolivian frontier. The capybara (<i>Hydrochoerus capybara</i>)
is also numerous in this region. Of birds the number of species
greatly exceeds that of the mammals, including the rhea of the
pampas and condor of the Andes, and the tiny, brilliant-hued
humming-birds of the tropical North. Vultures and hawks are well
represented, but perhaps the most numerous of all are the parrots,
of which there are six or seven species. The reptilians are represented
in the Paraná by the jacaré (<i>Alligator sclerpos</i>), and on land by the
&ldquo;iguana&rdquo; (<i>Teius teguexim, Podinema teguixin</i>), and some species of
lizard. Serpents are numerous, but only two are described as
poisonous, the cascavel (rattlesnake) and the &ldquo;vibora de la cruz&rdquo;
(<i>Trigonocephalus alternatus</i>).<a name="fa2b" id="fa2b" href="#ft2b"><span class="sp">2</span></a></p>

<p><i>Population</i>.&mdash;In population Argentina ranks second among
the republics of South America, having outstripped, during the
last quarter of the 19th century, the once more populous states
of Colombia and Peru. During the first half of the 19th century
civil war and despotic government seriously restricted the natural
growth of the country, but since the definite organization of the
republic in 1860 and the settlement of disturbing political
controversies, the population had increased rapidly. Climate
and a fertile soil have been important elements in this growth.
According to the first national census of 1869 the population
was 1,830,214. The census of 1895 increased this total to
3,954,911, exclusive of wild Indians and a percentage for omissions
customarily used in South American census returns. In 1904
official estimates, based on immigration and emigration returns
and upon registered births and deaths, both of which are admittedly
defective, showed a population increased to 5,410,028,
and a small diminution in the rate of annual increase from 1895
to 1904 as compared with 1860-1895. The birth-rate is exceptionally
high, largely because of the immigrant population,
the greater part of which is concentrated in or near the large
cities. In the rural districts of the northern provinces, the
increase in population is much less than in the central provinces,
the conditions of life being less favourable. According to the
official returns,<a name="fa3b" id="fa3b" href="#ft3b"><span class="sp">3</span></a> the over-sea immigration for the forty-seven
years 1857-1903 aggregated 2,872,588, while the departure of
emigrants during the same period was 1,066,480, showing a net
addition to the population of 1,806,108. A considerable percentage
of these arrivals and departures represents seasonal
labourers, who come out from Europe solely for the Argentine
wheat harvest and should not be classed as immigrants. Unfavourable
political and economic conditions of a temporary
character influence the emigration movement. During the years
1880-1889, when the country enjoyed exceptional prosperity,
the arrivals numbered 1,020,907 and the departures only 175,038,
but in 1890-1899, a period of financial depression following the
extravagant Celman administration, the arrivals were 928,865
and the departures 532,175. Another disturbing influence has
been the high protective tariffs, adopted during the closing years
of the century, which increased the costs of living more rapidly
than the wages for labour, and compelled thousands of immigrants
to seek employment elsewhere. The influence of such legislation
on unsettled immigrant labourers may be seen in the number
of Italians who periodically migrate from Argentina to Brazil,
and <i>vice versa</i>, seeking to better their condition. Of the immigrant
arrivals for the forty-seven years given, 1,331,536 were Italians,
414,973 Spaniards, 170,293 French, 37,953 Austrians, 35,435
British, 30,699 Germans, 25,775 Swiss, 19,521 Belgians, and the
others of diverse nationalities, so that Argentina is in no danger
of losing her Latin character through immigration. This large
influx of Europeans, however, is modifying the population by
reducing the Indian and <i>mestizo</i> elements to a minority, although
they are still numerous in the mesopotamian, northern and
north-western provinces. The language is Spanish.</p>

<p><i>Science and Literature</i>.&mdash;Though the university of Córdoba
is the oldest but one in South America, it has made no conspicuous
contribution to Argentine literature beyond the historical
works of its famous rector, Gregorio Funes (1749-1830).
This university was founded in 1621 and the university of
Buenos Aires in 1821, but although Bonpland and some other
European scientists were members of the faculty of Buenos Aires
in its early years, neither there nor at Córdoba was any marked
attention given to the natural sciences until President Sarmiento
(official term, 1868-1874) initiated scientific instruction at the
university of Córdoba under the eminent German naturalist,
Dr Hermann Burmeister (1807-1892), and founded the National
Observatory at Córdoba and placed it under the direction of
the noted American astronomer, Benjamin Apthorp Gould
(1824-1896). Both of these men made important contributions
to science, and rendered an inestimable service to the country,
not only through their publications but also through the interest
they aroused in scientific research. A bureau of meteorology
was afterwards created at Córdoba which has rendered valuable
service. Dr Burmeister was afterwards placed in charge of the
provincial museum of Buenos Aires, and devoted himself to the
acquisition of a collection of fossil remains, now in the La Plata
museum, which ranks among the best of the world. Not only has
scientific study advanced at the university of Buenos Aires,
but scientific research is promoting the development of the
country; examples are the geographical explorations of the
Andean frontier, and especially of the Patagonian Andes, by
Francisco P. Moreno. In literature Argentina is still under the
spell of Bohemianism and dilettanteism. Exceptions are the
admirable biographies of Manuel Belgrano (d. 1820) and San
Martin, important contributions to the history of the country
and of the war of independence, by ex-President Bartolomé
Mitre (1821-1906). Buenos Aires has some excellent daily
journals, but the tone of the press in general is sensational.
The number of newspapers published is large, especially in
Buenos Aires, where in 1902 the total, including sundry periodicals,
was 183.</p>

<p><i>Political Divisions and Towns</i>.&mdash;The chief political divisions
of the republic consist of one federal district, 14 provinces and
10 territories, the last in great part dating from the settlement
of the territorial controversies with Chile. For purposes of local
administration the provinces are divided into departments.

<p>The principal towns, with estimated population for 1905,
are as follows: Buenos Aires (1,025,653), Rosario (129,121),
La Plata (85,000), Tucumán (55,000), Córdoba (43.000), Sante Fé
(33,200), Mendoza (32,000), Paraná (27,000), Salta (18,000),
Corrientes (18,000), Chivilcoy (15,000), Gualeguaychú (13,300),

<div class="condensed">
<p><i>Communications</i>.&mdash;The development of railways in Argentina,
which dates from 1857 when the construction of the Buenos Aires
Western was begun, was at first slow and hesitating, but after 1880
it went forward rapidly. Official corruption and speculation have
led to some unsound ventures, but in the great majority of cases the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page465" id="page465"></a>465</span>
lines constructed have been beneficial and productive. The principal
centres of the system are Buenos Aires, Rosario and Bahia Blanca,
with La Plata as a secondary centre to the former, and from these the
lines radiate westward and northward. The creation of a commercial
port at Bahia Blanca and the development of the territories
of La Pampa, Rio Negro and Neuquen, have given an impetus to
railway construction in that region, and new lines are being extended
toward the promising districts among the Andean foothills. Beginning
with 6 m. in 1857, the railway mileage of the republic increased
to 1563 m. in 1880, 5865 m. in 1890, 7752 m. in 1891, 10,304 m. in
1901, and 12,274 m. in 1906, with 1794 m. under construction.
The greater development of railway construction between 1885 and
1891 was due, principally, to the dubious concessions of interest
guarantees by the Celman administration, and also to the fever
of speculation. Some of these lines resulted disastrously. The
Transandine line, designed to open railway communication between
Buenos Aires and Valparaiso, was so far completed early in 1909
that on the Argentine side only the summit tunnel, 2 m. 127 yds.
long, remained to be finished. The piercing was completed in Nov.
1909, but in the meantime passengers were conveyed by road over
the pass. The gauge is broken at Mendoza, the Buenos Aires and
Pacific having a gauge of 5 ft. 6 in. and the Transandine of one metre.</p>

<p>Tramway lines, which date from 1870, are to be found in all
important towns. Those of Buenos Aires, Rosario and La Plata
are owned by public companies. According to the census returns of
1895, the total mileage was 496 m., representing a capital expenditure
of $84,044,581 paper. Electric traction was first used in Buenos
Aires in 1897, since when nearly all the lines of that city have been
reconstructed to meet its requirements, and subways are contemplated
to relieve the congested street traffic of the central districts;
the companies contribute 6% of their gross receipts to the municipality,
besides paying $50 per annum per square on each single track
in paved streets, 5 per thousand on the value of their property, and
33% of the cost of street repaving and renewals.</p>

<p>The telegraph lines of Argentina are subject to the national
telegraph law of 1875, the international telegraph conventions, and
special conventions with Brazil and Uruguay. In 1902 the total
length of wires strung was 28,125 m.; in 1906 it had been increased
to 34,080 m. The national lines extend from Buenos Aires north to
La Quiaca on the Bolivian frontier (1180 m.), and south to Cape
Virgenes (1926 m.), at the entrance to the Straits of Magellan.
Telegraphic communication with Europe is effected by cables laid
along the Uruguayan and Brazilian coasts, and by the Brazilian
land lines to connect with transatlantic cables from Pernambuco.
Communication with the United States is effected by land lines to
Valparaiso, and thence by a cable along the west coast. The service
is governed by the international telegraph regulations, but is subject
to local inspection and interruption in times of political disorder.</p>

<p>The postal and telegraph services are administered by the national
government, and are under the immediate supervision of the minister
of the interior. Argentina has been a member of the Postal Union
since 1878. Owing to the great distances which must be covered,
and also to the defective means of communication in sparsely settled
districts, the costs of the postal service in Argentina are unavoidably
high in relation to the receipts.</p>

<p><i>Shipping</i>.&mdash;Although Argentina has an extensive coast-line, and
one of the great fluvial systems of the world, the tonnage of steamers
and sailing vessels flying her flag is comparatively small. In 1898
the list comprised only 1416 sailing vessels of all classes, from 10 tons
up, with a total tonnage of 118,894 tons, and 222 steamships, of
36,323 tons. There has been but slight improvement since that date.
There are excellent fishing grounds on the coast, but they have had
no appreciable influence in developing a commerical marine. The
steamships under the national flag are almost wholly engaged in
the traffic between Buenos Aires and Montevideo, the river traffic,
and port services.</p>

<p><i>Agriculture</i>.&mdash;In 1878 the production of wheat was insufficient
for home consumption, the amount of Indian corn grown barely
covered local necessities, and the only market for live stock
was in the slaughtering establishments, where the meat
<span class="sidenote">Live stock, &amp;c.</span>
was cut into strips and cured, making the so-called
&ldquo;jerked beef&rdquo; for the Brazilian and Cuban markets. But three
years later a new economic development began. In 1881 President
Roca offered for public purchase by auction the lands in the south-west
of the province of Buenos Aires, the Pampa Central, and the
Neuquen district, these lands having been rendered habitable after
the campaign of 1878 against the Indians. The upset (reserve) price
was £80 sterling per square league of 6669 acres, and, as the lands
were quickly sold, an expansion of the pastoral industry immediately
ensued. The demand for animals for stock-breeding purposes sent
up prices, and this acted as a stimulus to other branches of trade,
so that, as peace under the Roca regime seemed assured, a steady
flow of immigration from Italy set in. The development of the
pastoral industry of Argentina from that time to the end of the
century was remarkable. In 1878 the number of cattle was
12,000,000; of sheep, 65,000,000; and of horses, 4,000,000; in
1899 the numbers were&mdash;cattle, 25,000,000; sheep, 89,000,000;
and horses, about 4,500,000. Originally the cattle were nearly all
of the long-horned Spanish breed and of little value for their meat,
except to the saladero establishments. Gradually Durham, Shorthorn,
Hereford and other stock were introduced to improve the
native breeds, with results so satisfactory that now herds of three-quarters-bred cattle are to be found in all parts of the country.
Holstein, Jersey and other well-known dairy breeds were imported
for the new industries of butter- and cheese-making. Not only has
the breed of cattle been improved, but the system of grazing has
completely altered. Vast areas of land have been ploughed and
sown with lucerne (alfalfa); magnificent permanent pasturage has
been created where there were coarse and hard grasses in former
days, and Argentina has been able to add baled hay to her list of
exports. In 1889 the first shipment of Argentine cattle, consisting
altogether of 1930 steers, was sent to England. The results of these
first experiments were not encouraging, owing mainly to the poor
class of animals, but the exporters persevered, and the business
steadily grew in value and importance, until in 1898 the number of
live cattle shipped was 359,296, which then decreased to 119,189
in 1901, because of the foot-and-mouth disease. In 1906 the export
of live stock was prohibited for that reason. Large quantities of
frozen and preserved meat are exported, profitable prices being
realized. Dairy-farming is making rapid strides, and the development
of sheep-farming has been remarkable. In 1878, 65,000,000
sheep yielded 230,000,000 Ib weight of wool, or an average per sheep
of, about 3½ &#8468; In the season of 1899-1900 the wool exports weighed
420,000,000 Ib, and averaged more than 5 &#8468; per sheep. The extra
weight of fleece was owing to the large importation of better breeds.
The export, moreover, of live sheep and of frozen mutton to Europe
has become an important factor in the trade of Argentina. In 1892
the number of live sheep shipped for foreign ports was 40,000; in
1898 the export reached a total of 577,813, which in 1901 fell off
to 25,746. In 1892 the frozen mutton exported was 25,500 tons,
and this had increased in 1901 to 63,013 tons.</p>

<p>The advance made in agricultural industry also is of very great
importance. In 1872 the cultivated area was about 1,430,000 acres;
in 1895, 12,083,000 acres; in 1901, 17,465,973 acres. In
1899 the wheat exports exceeded 50,000,000 bushels, and
<span class="sidenote">Crops.</span>
the Indian corn 40,000,000 bushels. The area under wheat in
1901 was 8,351,843 acres; Indian corn, 3,102,140 acres; linseed,
1,512,340 acres; alfalfa, 3,088,929 acres. The farming industry is
not, however, on a satisfactory basis. No national lands in accessible
districts are available for the application of a homestead law, and
the farmer too often has no interest in the land beyond the growing
crops, a percentage of the harvest being the rent charged by the
owner of the property. This system is mischievous, since, if a few,
consecutive bad seasons occur, the farmer moves to some more
favoured spot; while, on the other hand, a succession of good years
tends to increase rents. The principal wheat and Indian corn producing
districts lie in the provinces of Santa Fé, Buenos Aires,
Córdoba and Entre Rios, and the average yield of wheat throughout
the country is about 12 bushels to the acre. Little attention is paid
to methods of cultivation, and the farmer has no resources to help
him if the cereal crops fail. In the Andean provinces of Mendoza,
San Juan, Catamarca and Rioja viticulture attracts much attention,
and the area in vineyards in 1901 was 109,546 acres, only 18% of
which was outside the four provinces named. Wine is manufactured
in large quantities, but the output is not sufficient to meet the home
demand. In the provinces of Tucumán, Salta and Jujuy the main
industry is sugar growing and manufacture. In 1901 the production
of sugar was 151,639 tons, of which 58,000 tons were exported.
The sugar manufacture, however, is a protected and bounty-fed
industry, and the 51 sugar mills in operation in 1901 are a
heavy tax upon consumers and taxpayers. Other products are
tobacco, olives, castor-oil, peanuts, canary-seed, barley, rye, fruit
and vegetables.</p>

<p>The pastoral and agricultural industries have been hampered by
fluctuations in the value of the currency, farm products being sold
at a gold value for the equivalent in paper, while labourers are paid
in currency. The existing system of taxation also presses heavily
upon the provinces, as may be seen from the fact that the national,
provincial and municipal exactions together amount to £7 per head
of population, while the total value of the exports in 1898 was only
£6 in round numbers. The <i>guia</i> tax on the transport of stock from
one province to another, which has been declared unconstitutional
in the courts, is still enforced, and is a vexatious tax upon the
stock-raiser, while the consumption, or <i>octroi</i>, tax in Buenos Aires
and other cities is a heavy burden upon small producers.</p>

<p><i>Manufactures</i>.&mdash;Manufacturing enterprise in Argentina, favoured
by the protection of a high tariff, made noticeable progress in the
national capital during the closing years of the last century, especially
in those small industries which commanded a secure market.
The principal classes of products affected are foods, wearing apparel,
building materials, furniture, &amp;c., chemical products, printing and
allied trades, and sundry others, such as cigars, matches, tanning,
paints, &amp;c. In some manufactures the raw material is imported
partly manufactured, such as thread for weaving. The lack of coal
in Argentina greatly increases the difficulty and cost of maintaining
these industries, and high prices of the products result. Electric
power generated by steam is now commonly used in Buenos Aires
and other large cities for driving light machinery.</p>

<p><i>Commerce</i>.&mdash;The rapid development of the foreign trade of the
republic since 1881 is due to settled internal conditions and to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page466" id="page466"></a>466</span>
prime necessity to the commercial world of many Argentine products,
such as beef, mutton, hides, wool, wheat and Indian corn. Efforts
to hasten this development have created some serious financial
and industrial crises, and have burdened the country with heavy
debts and taxes. During the decade 1881-1890 great sums of
European capital were invested in railways and other undertakings,
encouraged by the grant of interest guarantees and by state mortgage
bank loans in the form of <i>cedulas</i>, nominally secured on landed
property. In 1890 the crisis came, the mortgage banks failed, credits
were contracted, the value of property declined, defaults were
common, imports decreased, and the losses to the country were
enormous. The constant fluctuations in the value of the currency,
then much depreciated, intensified the distress and complicated the
situation. Recovery required years, although made easier by the
sound and steady development of the pastoral and agricultural
industries, which were slightly affected by the crisis; and the steadily
increasing volume of exports, mainly foodstuffs and other staples,
saved the situation. There have been some changes in commercial
methods since 1890, the retailer, and sometimes the consumer,
importing direct to save intermediate commission charges. Such
transactions are made easy by the foreign banks established in all
the large cities of the republic. The conversion law of 1899, which
gave a fixed gold value to the currency (44 centavos gold for each 100
centavos paper), has had beneficial influence on commercial transactions,
through the elimination of daily fluctuations in the value of
the currency, and the commercial and financial situation has been
steadily improved, notwithstanding heavy taxation and tariff restrictions.
The import trade shows the largest totals in foodstuffs,
wines and liquors, textiles and raw materials for their manufacture,
wood and its manufactures, iron and its manufactures, paper and
cardboard, glass and ceramic wares. The official valuation of
imports, which is arbitrary and incorrect, was $164,569,884 gold in
1889, fell off to $67,207,780 in 1891, but gradually increased to
$205,154,420 in 1905. The exports, which are almost wholly of
agricultural and pastoral products, increased from $103,219,000 in
1891 to $322,843,841 in 1905.</p>

<p><i>Government</i>.&mdash;The present constitution of Argentina dates
from the 25th of September 1860. The legislative power is
vested in a congress of two chambers&mdash;the senate, composed of
30 members (two from each province and two from the capital),
elected by the provincial legislatures and by a special body of
electors in the capital for a term of nine years; and the chamber
of deputies, of 120 members (1906), elected for four years by
direct vote of the people, one deputy for every 33,000 inhabitants.
To the chamber of deputies exclusively belongs the initiation
of all laws relating to the raising of money and the conscription
of troops. It has also the exclusive right to impeach the
president, vice-president, cabinet ministers, and federal judges
before the senate. The executive power is exercised by the
president, elected by presidential electors from each province
chosen by direct vote of the people. The president and vice-president
are voted for by separate tickets. The system closely
resembles that followed in the United States. The president
must be a native citizen of Argentina, a Roman Catholic, not
under thirty years of age, and must have an annual income of at
least $2000. His term of office is six years, and neither he nor
the vice-president is eligible for the next presidential term.
All laws are sanctioned and promulgated by the president, who
is invested with the veto power, which can be overruled only by
a two-thirds vote. The president, with the advice and consent
of the senate, appoints judges, diplomatic agents, governors of
territories, and officers of the army and navy above the rank
of colonel. All other officers and officials he appoints and promotes
without the consent of the senate. The cabinet is composed
of eight ministers&mdash;the heads of the government departments
of the interior, foreign affairs, finance, war, marine,
justice, agriculture, and public works. They are appointed by
and may be removed by the president.</p>

<p>Justice is administered by a supreme federal court of five
judges and an attorney-general, which is also a court of appeal,
four courts of appeal, with three judges each, located in Buenos
Aires, La Plata, Paraná and Córdoba, and by a number of
inferior and local courts. Each province has also its own
judicial system. Trial by jury is established by the constitution,
but never practised. Civil and criminal courts are both corrupt
and dilatory. In May 1899 the minister of justice stated in the
chamber of deputies that the machinery of the courts in the
country was antiquated, unwieldy and incapable of performing
its duties; that 50,000 cases were then waiting decision in the
minor courts, and 10,000 in the federal division; and that a
reconstruction of the judiciary and the judicial system had
become necessary. In June 1899 he sent his project for the
reorganization of the legal procedure to congress, but no action
was then taken beyond referring the bill to a committee for
examination and report. The proceedings are, with but few
exceptions, written, and the procedure is a survival of the antiquated
Spanish system.</p>

<p>Under the constitution, the provinces retain all the powers not
delegated to the federal government. Each province has its
own constitution, which must be republican in form and in
harmony with that of the nation. Each elects its governor,
legislators and provincial functionaries of all classes, without
the intervention of the federal government. Each has its own
judicial system, and enacts laws relating to the administration
of justice, the distribution and imposition of taxes, and all
matters affecting the province. All the public acts and judicial
decisions of one province have full legal effect and authority
in all the others. In cases of armed resistance to a provincial
government, the national government exercises the right to
intervene by the appointment of an interventor, who becomes the
executive head of the province until order is restored. The territories
are under the direct control of the national government.</p>

<p><i>Army</i>.&mdash;The military service of the republic was reorganized
in 1901, and is compulsory for all citizens between the ages of
20 and 45. The army consists of: (1) The Line, comprising
the Active and Reserve, in which all citizens 20 to 28 years
of age are obliged to serve; (2) the National Guard, comprising
citizens of 28 to 40 years; (3) the Territorial Guard, comprising
those 40 to 45 years. Conscripts of 20 years of age have to
serve two years, three months each year. The active or standing
army comprises 18 battalions of infantry, 12 regiments of
cavalry, 8 regiments of artillery, and 4 battalions of engineers.
A military school, with 125 cadets, is maintained at San Martin,
near the national capital, and a training school for non-commissioned
officers in the capital itself. Compulsory attendance
of young men at national guard drills is enforced for at least
two months of the year, under penalty of enforced service in the
Line. In 1906 the president announced that permission had
been given by the German emperor for 30 Argentine officers to
enter the German army each year and to serve eighteen months,
and also for five officers to attend the Berlin Military Academy.
The equipment of the standing army is thoroughly modern, the
infantry being provided with Mauser rifles and the artillery with
Krupp batteries.</p>

<p><i>Navy</i>.&mdash;The disputes with Chile during the closing years of
the 19th century led to a large increase in the navy, but in 1902
a treaty between the two countries provided for the restriction
of further armaments for the next four years. The naval vessels
then under construction were accordingly sold, but in 1906 both
countries, influenced apparently by the action of Brazil, gave
large orders in Europe for new vessels. At the time when further
armaments were suspended, the effective strength of the
Argentine navy consisted of 3 ironclads, 6 first-class armoured
cruisers, 2 monitors (old), 4 second-class cruisers, 2 torpedo
cruisers, 3 destroyers, 3 high-sea torpedo boats, 14 river torpedo
boats, 1 training ship, 5 transports, and various auxiliary
vessels. Two of these first-class cruisers were sold to Japan.
The armament included 394 guns of all calibres, 6 of which were
of 250 millimetres, 4 of 240, and 12 of 200. There are about
320 officers in active service, and the total personnel ranges
from 5000 to 6000 men. The service is not popular, and it is
recruited by means of conscription from the national guard, the
term of service being two years. These conscripts number
about 2000 a year. In addition, there is a corps of coast artillery
numbering 450 men, from which garrisons are drawn for the
military port, Zárate arsenal and naval prison. The government
maintains a naval school at Flores, a school of mechanics
in Buenos Aires, an artillery school on the cruiser &ldquo;Patagonia,&rdquo;
and a school for torpedo practice at La Plata. The
naval arsenal is situated on the &ldquo;north basin&rdquo; of the Buenos
Aires port, and the military port at Bahia Blanca is provided
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page467" id="page467"></a>467</span>
with a dry dock of the largest size, and extensive repair shops.
There is also a dockyard and torpedo arsenal at La Plata,
an artillery depot at Zárate, above Buenos Aires, and naval
depots on the island of Martin Garcia and at Tigre, on the
Luján river.</p>

<p><i>Education</i>.&mdash;Primary education is free and secular, and is
compulsory for children of 6 to 14 years. In the national
capital and territories it is supervised by a national council
of education with the assistance of local school boards; in the
14 provinces it is under provincial control. Secondary instruction
is also free, but is not compulsory. It is under the
control of the national government, which in 1902 maintained
10 colleges. Of these colleges four are in Buenos Aires, one in
each province, and one in Conceptión del Uruguay. For the
instruction of teachers the republic has 28 normal schools, as
follows: three in the national capital; one in Paraná, three
(regional) in Corrientes, San Luis and Catamarca; 14 for
female teachers in the provincial capitals; and seven for either
sex in the larger towns of the provinces of Buenos Aires, Santa
Fé, Córdoba and San Luis. The normal schools, maintained by
the state on a secular basis, were founded by President Sarmiento,
who engaged experienced teachers in the United States to direct
them; their work is excellent; notably, their model primary
schools. For higher and professional education there are two
national universities at Buenos Aires and Córdoba, and three
provincial universities, at La Plata, Santa Fé and Paraná, which
comprise faculties of law, medicine and engineering, in addition
to the usual courses in arts and science. To meet the needs
of technical and industrial education there are a school of mines
at San Juan, a school of viticulture at Mendoza, an agronomic
and veterinary school at La Plata, several agricultural and
pastoral schools, and commercial schools in Buenos Aires,
Rosario, Bahia Blanca and Concordia. Schools of art and
conservatories of music are also maintained in the large cities,
where there are, besides, many private schools. Secular education
has been vigorously opposed by strict churchmen, and
efforts have been made to maintain separate schools under
church control. The national government has founded several
scholarships (some in art) for study abroad. The total school
population of Argentina in 1900 (6 to 14 years) was 994,089, of
which 45% attended school, and 13% of those not attending
were able to read and write. The illiterate school population
was about 41%, and of those of 15 years and over 54% were
illiterate. Of the whole population over 6 years, 50.5% were
illiterate.</p>

<p><i>Religion</i>.&mdash;The Argentine constitution recognizes the Roman
Catholic religion as that of the state, but tolerates all others.
The state controls all ecclesiastical appointments, decides on
the passing or rejection of all decrees of the Holy See, and
provides an annual subsidy for maintenance of the churches and
clergy. Churches and chapels are founded and maintained by
religious orders and private gift as well. At the head of the
Argentine hierarchy are one archbishop and five suffragan
bishops, who have five seminaries for the education of the
priesthood. From statistics of 1895 it appears that in each
1000 of population 991 are Roman Catholics, 7 Protestants, and
2 Jews, the Jews being entirely of Russian origin, sent into the
republic since 1891 by the Jewish Colonization Association
under the provisions of the Hirsch legacy; from 1895 to 1908
the number of Jews in Argentina increased from 6085 to about
30,000.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p><i>Finance</i>.&mdash;The revenue of the republic is derived mainly from
customs and excise, and the largest item of expenditure is the service
of the public debt. Since 1891 the national budgets have been
calculated in both gold and currency, and both receipts and expenditures
have been carried out in this dual system. The collection
of a part of the import duties in gold has served to give the government
the gold it requires for certain expenditures, but it has complicated
returns and accounts and increased the burden of taxation.
According to a compilation of statistical returns published by Dr.
Francisco Latzina in 1901, the national revenues and expenditures
for the 37 years from 1864 to 1900, inclusive, reduced to a
common standard, show a total deficit for that period of $408,260,795
gold, which has been met by external and internal loans, and by a
continued increase in the scope and rate of taxation. The growth
of the annual budget is shown by a comparison of the following
years:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pt2">The bane of Argentine finance has been the extravagant and unscrupulous
use of national credit for the promotion of schemes
calculated to benefit individuals rather than the public. The large
increase in military expenditures during the disputes with Chile
also proved a heavy burden, and in the continued strife with Brazil
for naval superiority this burden could not fail to be increased greatly.
A very considerable percentage of Argentina&rsquo;s population of five
to six millions is hopelessly poor and unprogressive, and cannot be
expected to bear its share of the burden. To meet these expenditures
there are a high tariff on imported merchandise, and excise and stamp
taxes of a far-reaching and often vexatious character. Nothing is
permitted to escape taxation, and duplicated taxes on the same thing
are frequent. In Argentina these burdens bear heavily upon the
labouring classes, and in years of depression they send away by
thousands immigrants unable to meet the high costs of living.
For the year 1900 the total expenditures of the national government,
14 provincial governments, and 16 principal cities, were estimated
to have been $208,811,925 paper, which is equivalent to $91,877,247
gold, or (at $5.04 per pound stg.) to £18,229,612, 10s. The population
that year was estimated to be 4,794,149, from which it is
seen that the annual costs of government were no less than £3, 16s.
for each man, woman, and child in the republic. About 71% of
this charge was on account of national expenditures, and 29%
provincial and municipal expenditures. Had the expenses of all
the small towns and rural communities been included, the total would
be in excess of $20 gold, or £4, <i>per capita</i>.</p>

<p>In 1889 the public debt of the republic amounted to about
£24,000,000, but the financial difficulties which immediately followed
that year, and the continuance of excessive expenditures, forced
the debt up to approximately £128,000,000 during the next ten
years. In the year 1905 the outstanding and authorized debt of the
republic was as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>The paper currency forms an important part of the internal debt,
and has been a fruitful source of trouble to the country. Few
countries have suffered more from a depreciated currency than
Argentina. During the era of so-called &ldquo;prosperity&rdquo; between
1881 and 1890 an enormous amount of bank notes were issued under
various authorizations, especially that of the &ldquo;free banking law&rdquo;
of 1887. During this period the bank-note circulation was increased
to $161,700,000, and two mortgage banks&mdash;the National Hypothecary
Bank and the Provincial Mortgage Bank (of Buenos Aires)&mdash;flooded
the country with $509,000,000 of <i>cedulas</i> (hypothecary
bonds). When the crash came and the national treasury was found
to be without resources to meet current expenses, further issues of
$110,000,000 in currency were made. The free-banking law which
permitted the issue of notes by provincial banks was primarily
responsible for this situation. Under the provisions of this law the
provinces were authorized to borrow specie abroad and deposit the
same with the national government as security for their issues.
These loans aggregated £27,000,000. The Celman administration,
in violation of the trust, then sold the specie and squandered the
proceeds, leaving the provincial bank notes without guarantee and
value. The national government has since assumed responsibility
for all these provincial loans abroad. As on previous occasions, the
great depreciation in the value of the currency has led to a repudiation
of part of its nominal value. This depreciation reached its
maximum in October 1891 ($460.82 paper for $100 gold), and
remained between that figure and $264 during the next six years.
To check these prejudicial fluctuations and to prevent too great
a fall in the price of gold (to repeat a popular misconception), a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page468" id="page468"></a>468</span>
conversion law was adopted on the 31st of October 1899, which provided
that the outstanding circulation should be redeemed at the rate of
44 centavos gold for each 100 centavos paper, the official rate for
gold being 227.27. Provisions were also made for the creation of
a special conversion fund in specie to guarantee the circulation,
which fund reached a total of $100,000,000 in March 1906. These
measures have served to give greater stability to the value of the
circulating medium, and to prevent the ruinous losses caused by a
constant fluctuation in value, but the rate established prevents the
further appreciation of the currency. On the 18th of January 1906
the currency in circulation amounted to $502,420,485, which is
more than $95 <i>per capita</i>.</p>

<p class="pt2 center sc">History</p>

<p>The first Europeans who visited the river Plate were a party
of Spanish explorers in search of a south-west passage to the
East Indies. Their leader, Juan Diaz de Solis, landing incautiously
in 1516 on the north coast with a few attendants to
parley with a body of Charrua Indians, was suddenly attacked
by them and was killed, together with a number of his followers.
This untoward disaster led to the abandonment of the expedition,
which forthwith returned to Spain, bringing with them the news
of the discovery of a fresh-water sea. Four years later (1520)
the Portuguese seaman, Ferdinand Magellan, entered the
estuary in his celebrated voyage round the world, undertaken
in the service of the king of Spain (Charles I., better known as
the emperor Charles V.). Magellan, as soon as he had satisfied
himself that there was no passage to the west, left the river
without landing.</p>

<p>The first attempt to penetrate by way of the river Plate and
its affluents inland, with a view to effecting settlements in the
interior, was made in 1526 by Sebastian Cabot. This
great navigator had already won renown in the service
<span class="sidenote">Cabot.</span>
of Henry VII. of England by his voyage to the coast of North
America in company with his father, Giovanni Caboto or Cabot
(see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Cabot, John</a></span>). Sebastian Cabot had in 1519 deserted
England for Spain, and had received from King Charles the post
of pilot-major formerly held by Juan de Solis. In 1526 he was
sent out in command of an expedition fitted out for the purpose
of determining by astronomical observations the exact line of
demarcation, under the treaty of Tordesillas, between, the colonizing
spheres of Spain and Portugal, and of conveying settlers
to the Moluccas. Arrived in the river Plate in 1527, rumours
reached Cabot of mineral wealth and a rich and civilized empire
in the far interior, and he resolved to abandon surveying for
exploration. He built a fort a short distance up the river
Uruguay, and despatched one of his lieutenants, Juan Alvarez
Ramon, with a separate party upon an expedition up stream.
This expedition was assailed by the Charruas and forced to
return on foot, their leader himself being killed. Cabot, with
a large following, entered the Paraná and established a settlement
just above the mouth of the river Carcarañal, to which
he gave the name of San Espiritù, among the Timbú Indians, with
whom he formed friendly relations. He continued the ascent
of the Paraná as far as the rapids of Apipé, and finding his course
barred in this direction, he afterwards explored the river Paraguay,
which he mounted as far as the mouth of the affluent
called by the Indians Lepeti, now the river Bermejo. His party
was here fiercely attacked by the Agaces or Payaguá Indians,
and suffered severely. Cabot in his voyage had seen many
silver ornaments in the possession of the Timbú and Guarani
Indians. Some specimens of these trinkets he sent back to
Spain with a report of his discoveries. The arrival of these
first-fruits of the mineral wealth of the southern continent
gained for the estuary of the Paraná the name which it has since
borne, that of Rio de la Plata, the silver river. As Cabot was
descending the stream to his settlement of San Espiritù, he
encountered an expedition which had been despatched from
Spain for the express purpose of exploring the river discovered
by Solis, under the command of Diego Garcia. Finding that
he had been forestalled, Garcia resolved to return home. Cabot
himself, after an absence of more than three years, came back
in 1530, and applied to Charles V. for means to open up communications
with Peru by way of the river Bermejo. The
emperor&rsquo;s resources were, however, absorbed by his struggle
for European supremacy with Francis I. of France, and he was
obliged to leave the enterprise of South American discoveries
to his wealthy nobles. Cabot&rsquo;s colony at San Espiritù did not
long survive his departure; an attempt of the chief of the Timbús
to gain possession of one of the Spanish ladies of the settlement
led to a treacherous massacre of the garrison.</p>

<p>Two years after the return of Cabot, the news of Francisco
Pizarro&rsquo;s marvellous conquest of Peru reached Europe (1532),
and stirred many an adventurous spirit to strive to
emulate his good fortune. Among these was Pedro
<span class="sidenote">Mendoza.</span>
de Mendoza, a Basque nobleman. He obtained from Charles V.
a grant (<i>asiento</i>) of two hundred leagues of the coast from the
boundary of the Portuguese possessions southward towards
the Straits of Magellan, and the inland country which lay behind
it. Mendoza undertook to conquer and settle the territory at
his own charges, certain profits being reserved to the crown.
In August 1534 the <i>adelantado</i>, or governor, sailed from San
Lucar, at the head of the largest and wealthiest expedition that
had ever left Europe for the New World. In January 1535 he
entered the river Plate, where he followed the northern shore to
the island of San Gabriel, and then crossing over he landed by
<span class="sidenote">Buenos Aires.</span>
a little stream, still called Riachuelo. The name of
Buenos Aires was given to the country by Sancho del
Campo, brother-in-law of the <i>adelantado</i>, who first
stepped ashore. Here, on the 2nd of February, Mendoza laid
the foundations of a settlement which in honour of the day
he named Santa Maria de Buenos Aires. Mendoza, after some
fierce encounters with the Indians, now proceeded up the Paraná,
and built a fort, which he called Corpus Christi, near the site of
Cabot&rsquo;s former settlement of San Espiritù. The expedition,
which originally numbered 2500 men, was reduced by deaths at
the hands of the Indians, by disease and privation, within a year
to less than 500 men. From Corpus Christi, Mendoza sent
out various bodies to explore the interior in the direction of
Peru, but without much success, and at length, thoroughly
discouraged and broken in health, he abandoned his enterprise,
and returned to Spain in 1537.</p>

<p>A portion of one of the expeditions he despatched, under Juan
de Ayolas, pushing up the Paraguay, is said to have reached
the south-east districts of Peru, but while returning laden with
booty, was attacked by the Payaguá Indians, and every man
<span class="sidenote">Asunción</span>
perished. The other portion, which had stayed behind as a reserve
under Domingos Iralá, had better fortunes. Finding their
comrades did not return, Iralá and his companions determined
to descend the river, and on their downward journey
opposite the mouth of the river Pilcomayo, finding
a suitable site for colonizing, they founded (1536)
what proved to be the first permanent Spanish settlement
in the interior of South America, the future city of Asunción
(15th August 1536).</p>

<p>In the meantime the colony at Buenos Aires had been dragging
on a miserable existence, and after terrible sufferings from
famine and from the ceaseless attacks of the Indians, the remaining
settlers abandoned the place and made their way up
<span class="sidenote">Iralá</span>
the river first to Corpus Christi, then to Asunción. Here, by
the emperor&rsquo;s orders, the assembled Spaniards proceeded to
the election of a captain-general, and their choice fell almost
unanimously on Domingos Martinez de Iralá, who
was proclaimed captain-general of the Rio de la Plata
(August 1538). In 1542 the settlement of Buenos Aires was
re-established by an expedition sent for the purpose from
Spain, under a tried <i>adelantado</i>, Cabeza de Vaca. This able
leader, eager to reach Asunción as quickly as possible, sent on
his ships to the river Plate, but himself with a small following
marched overland from Santa Catherina on the coast of Brazil
to join Iralá. His doings at Asunción belong, however, not to
the history of Argentina, but of Paraguay. Suffice it to say
that differences with Iralá eventually led to his arrest, and to his
being sent back to Spain to answer to the charges brought against
him for maladministration. The second settlement made by
his expedition at Buenos Aires was even less successful and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page469" id="page469"></a>469</span>
long-lived than the first. Exposed to the incessant attacks of
the savages, the piace was a second time abandoned, February
1543.</p>

<p>Forty years were now to elapse before any further efforts
were made by the Spaniards to colonize any part of the territory
of the river Plate and lower Paraná. In 1573 Juan
de Garay, at the head of an expedition despatched
<span class="sidenote">Juan de Garay.</span>
from Asunción, founded the city of Santa Fé near
the abandoned settlements of San Espiritù and Corpus Christi.
Seven years later (1580), when the new colony had been firmly
established, Juan de Garay proceeded southwards, and made
the third attempt to build a city on the site of Buenos Aires;
and despite the determined hostility of the Querendi Indians
he succeeded in finally gaining a complete mastery over them.
In a desperate battle, the natives were defeated with great
slaughter, and the territory surrounding the town was divided
into ranches, in which the conquered natives had to labour.
The new town received from Garay the name of <i>Ciudad de la
Santissima Trinidad</i>, while its port retained the old appellation
of Santa Maria de Buenos Aires. It was endowed by its founder
with a <i>cabildo</i> (corporation) and full Spanish municipal privileges.
Garay, when on his way to Santa Fé, was unfortunately murdered
by a party of Indians, Minuas (Mimas), three years later, while
incautiously sleeping on the river bank near the ruins of San
Espiritù. The new settlement, however, continued to prosper,
and the cattle and horses brought from Europe multiplied and
spread over the plains of the Pampas.</p>

<p>In the meantime the Spaniards had penetrated into the
interior of what is now the Argentine Republic, and established
themselves on the eastern slopes of the Andes. In 1553 an expedition
from Peru made their way through the mountain region
and founded the city of Santiago del Estero, that of Tucumán
in 1565, and that of Córdoba in 1573. Another expedition from
Chile, under Garcia Hurtado de Mendoza, crossed the Cordillera
in 1559, and having defeated the Araucanian Indians, made
a settlement which from the name of the leader was called
Mendoza. In 1620 Buenos Aires was separated from the
authority of the government established at Asunción, and was
made the seat of a government extending over Mendoza, Santa
Fé, Entre Rios and Corrientes, but at the same time remained
like the government of Paraguay at Asunción, and that of the
province of Tucumán, which had Córdoba as its capital, subject
to the authority of the viceroyalty of Peru.</p>

<p>Thus at the opening of the 17th century, after many adventurous
efforts, and the expenditure of many lives and much
treasure, the Spaniards found themselves securely
established on the river Plate, and had planted a
<span class="sidenote">Evils of Spanish colonial system.</span>
number of centres of trade and colonization in the
interior. Unfortunately, in no part of the Spanish
oversea possessions did the restrictive legislation of the home
government operate more harshly or disadvantageously to the
interests of the colony; it was a more effective hindrance to
the development of its resources and the spread of civilization
over the country, than the hostility of the Indians. Cabot had
urged the feasibility of opening an easier channel for trade with
the interior of Peru through the river Plate and its tributaries,
than that by way of the West Indies and Panama; and now
that his views were able to be realized, the interests of the
merchants of Seville and of Lima, who had secured a monopoly
of the trade by the route of the isthmus, were allowed to destroy
the threatened rivalry of that by the river Plate. Never in the
history of colonization has a mother country pursued so relentlessly
a policy more selfish and short-sighted. Spanish legislation
was not satisfied with endeavouring to exclude all European
nations except Spain from trading with the West Indies,
but it sought to limit all commerce to one particular route, and
it forbade any trade being transacted by way of the river Plate,
thus enacting the most flagrant injustice towards the people
it had encouraged to settle in the latter country. The strongest
protests were raised, but the utmost they could effect was that,
in 1618, permission was granted to export from Buenos Aires
two shiploads of produce a year. But the Spanish government
was not content with the prohibition of sea-borne commerce.
To prevent internal trade with Peru a custom-house was set up
at Córdoba to levy a duty of 50% on everything in transit to
and from the river Plate. In 1665 the relaxation of this system
was brought about by the continual remonstrances of the people,
<span class="sidenote">Asiento question.</span>
but for more than a century afterwards (until 1776)
the policy of exclusion was enforced. This naturally
led to a contraband trade of considerable dimensions.
The English, after the treaty of Utrecht (1715) held the contract
(<i>asiento</i>) for supplying the Spanish-American colonies with negro
slaves. Among other places the slave ships regularly visited
Buenos Aires, and despite the efforts of the Spanish authorities,
contrived both to smuggle in and carry away a quantity of
goods. This illicit commerce went on steadily till 1739, when
it led to an outbreak of war between England and Spain, which
put an end to the <i>asiento</i>. The Portuguese were even worse
offenders, for in 1680 they made a settlement on the north of the
river Plate, right opposite to Buenos Aires, named Colonia,
which with one or two short intervals, remained in their hands
till 1777. From this port foreign merchandise found its way
duty free into the Spanish provinces of Buenos Aires, Tucumán
and Paraguay, and even into the interior of Peru. The continual
encroachments of the Portuguese at length led the Spanish
government to take the important step of making Buenos Aires
the seat of a viceroyalty with jurisdiction over the territories
of the present republics of Bolivia, Paraguay, Uruguay and the
Argentine Confederation (1776). At the same time all this
country was opened to Spanish trade even with Peru, and the
development of its resources, so long thwarted, was allowed
comparatively free play. Pedro de Zeballos, the first viceroy,
took with him from Spain a large military force with which he
finally expelled the Portuguese from the banks of the river Plate.</p>

<p>The wars of the French Revolution, in which Spain was allied
with France against Great Britain, interrupted the growing
prosperity of Buenos Aires. On the 17th of June 1806
General William Beresford landed with a body of
<span class="sidenote">Effects of French war.</span>
troops from a British fleet under the command of Sir
Home Popham, and obtained possession of Buenos
Aires. But a French officer, Jacques de Liniers, gathered
together a large force with which he enclosed the British within
the walls, and finally, on the 12th of August, by a successful
assault, forced Beresford and his troops to surrender. In July
1807 another British force of eight thousand men under General
Whitelock endeavoured to regain possession of Buenos Aires,
but strenuous preparations had been made for resistance, and
after fierce street fighting the invading army, after suffering
severe losses, was compelled to capitulate. The colonists,
who had achieved their two great successes without any aid from
the home government, were naturally elated, and began to feel
a new sense of self-reliance and confidence in their own resources.
The successful defence of Buenos Aires accentuated the growing
feeling of dissatisfaction with the Spanish connexion, which was
soon to lead to open insurrection. The establishment of the
Napoleonic dynasty at Madrid was the actual cause which
brought about the disturbances which were to end in separation.
Liniers was viceroy on the arrival of the news of the crowning of
Joseph Bonaparte as king of Spain, but as a Frenchman he was
distrusted and was deposed by the adherents of Ferdinand VII.
The central junta at Seville, acting in the name of Ferdinand,
appointed Balthasar de Cisneros to be viceroy in his place. He
entered upon the duties of his office on the 19th of July 1809,
and at first he gained popularity by acceding to the urgent
appeals of the people and throwing open the trade of the country
to all nations. But his measures speedily gave dissatisfaction
to the Argentine or Creole party, who had long chafed under the
disabilities of Spanish rule, and who now felt themselves no longer
bound by ties of loyalty to a country which was in the possession
of the French armies.</p>

<p>On the 25th of May 1810 a great armed assembly met at
Buenos Aires and a provisional junta was formed to supersede
the authority of the viceroy and carry on the government. The
acts of the new government ran in the name of Ferdinand VII.,
<span class="sidenote">Struggle for independence.</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page470" id="page470"></a>470</span>
but the step taken was a revolutionary one, and the 25th
of May has ever since been regarded as the birthday of Argentine
independence. The most prominent leader of
the junta was its secretary Mariano Moreno (1778-1811),
who with a number of other active supporters
of the patriot cause succeeded in raising a considerable
force of Buenos Aireans to maintain, arms in hand, their nationalist
and anti-Spanish doctrines. An attempt of the Spanish
party to make Balthasar de Cisneros president of the junta
failed, and the ex-viceroy retired to Montevideo. A sanguinary
struggle between the party of independence and the adherents
of Spain spread over the whole country, and was carried on with
varying fortune. Foremost among the leaders of the revolutionary
armies were Manuel Belgrano, and after March 1812 General
José de San Martin, an officer who had gained experience against
the French in the Peninsular War. A state of disorder, almost
of anarchy, reigned in the provinces, but on the 25th of March
1816 a congress of deputies was assembled at Tucumán, who
named Don Martin Pueyrredón supreme director, and on the 9th
of July the separation of the united provinces of the Rio de la
Plata was formally proclaimed, and comparative order was
re-established in the country; Buenos Aires was declared the
seat of the government. The jealousy of the provinces, however,
against the capital led to a series of disturbances, and for many
years continual civil war devastated every part of the country.
Bolivia, Paraguay and Uruguay rose in armed revolt, and
finally established themselves as separate republics, whilst the
city of Buenos Aires itself was torn with faction and the scene
of many a sanguinary fight.</p>

<p>From 1816, however, the independence of the Argentine
Republic was assured, and success attended the South Americans
in their contest with the royal armies. The combined
forces of Buenos Aires and Chile defeated the Spaniards
<span class="sidenote">Republic established.</span>
at Chacabuco in 1817, and at Maipú in 1818; and
from Chile the victorious general José de San Martin
led his troops into Peru, where on the 9th of July 1821, he made
a triumphal entry into Lima, which had been the chief stronghold
of the Spanish power, having from the time of its foundation
by Pizarro been the seat of government of a viceroyalty which
at one time extended to the river Plate. A general congress
was assembled at Buenos Aires on the 1st of March 1822, of
representatives from all the liberated provinces, and a general
amnesty was decreed, though the war was not over until the 9th
of December 1824, when the republican forces gained the final,
victory of Ayacucho, in the Peruvian border-land. The Spanish
government did not, however, formally acknowledge the independence
of the country until the year 1842. On the 23rd of
January 1825, a national constitution for the federal states, which
formed the Argentine Republic, was decreed; and on the 2nd of
February of the same year Sir Woodbine Parish, acting under
the instructions of George Canning, signed a commercial treaty
in Buenos Aires, by which the British government acknowledged
the independence of the country. It had already been recognized
by the United States of America two years previously.</p>

<p>In 1826 Bernardo Rivadavia was elected president of the
confederation. His policy was to establish a strong central
government, and he became the head of a party known
as Unitarians in contradistinction to their opponents,
<span class="sidenote">Unitarians and Federalists.</span>
who were styled Federalists, their aim being to maintain
to the utmost the local autonomy of the various
provinces. Under the government of Rivadavia the people of
Buenos Aires became involved, practically single-handed, in a
war with Brazil in defence of the Banda Oriental, which had
been seized by the imperial forces (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Uruguay</a></span>). The Brazilians
were defeated, notably at Ituzaingo, and in 1827 the war issued
in the independence of Uruguay. Rivadavia&rsquo;s term of office was
likewise memorable for the constitution of the 24th of December
1826, passed by the constituent congress of all the provinces,
by which the bonds which united the confederated states of the
Argentine Republic were strengthened. This project of closer
union met, however, with much opposition both at Buenos Aires
and the provinces. Rivadavia resigned, and Vicente Lopez,
a Federalist, was elected to succeed him, but was speedily displaced
by Manuel Dorrego (1827), another representative of the
same party. The carrying out of Federalist principles led,
however, to the formation in the republic of a number of
quasi-independent military states, and Dorrego only ruled in Buenos
Aires. After the conclusion of the peace with Brazil, the Unitarians
placed themselves under the leadership of General
Juan de Lavalle, the victor of Ituzaingo. Lavalle, at the head of
a division of troops, drove Dorrego from Buenos Aires, pursued
him into the interior, and captured him. He was shot (December
9, 1828), by the order of Lavalle, and during the year 1828 the
country was given up to the horrors of civil war.</p>

<p>On the death of Dorrego, a remarkable man, Juan Manuel de
Rosas, became the Federalist chief. In 1829 he defeated Lavalle,
made himself master of Buenos Aires, and in the course
of the next three years made his authority recognized
<span class="sidenote">Rosas dictator.</span>
after much fighting throughout the provinces. The
Unitarians were relentlessly hunted down and a veritable reign
of terror ensued. Rosas gradually concentrated all power in
his own hands, and was hailed by the populace as a saviour of
the state. In 1835, with the title of governor and captain-general,
he acquired dictatorial powers, and all public authority
passed into his hands. This dictatorship of Rosas continued
until 1852. In every department of administration and of
government he was supreme. He was exceedingly jealous of
foreign interference, and quarrelled with France on questions
connected with the rights of foreign residents. Buenos Aires was
in 1838 blockaded by a French fleet; but Rosas stood firm.
A formidable revolt took place in 1839 under General Lavalle,
who had returned to the country accompanied by a number
of banished Unitarians. In 1840 he invaded Buenos Aires at
the head of troops raised chiefly in the province of Entre Rios;
but he was defeated at Santa Fé, then at Luján, and finally was
captured in Jujuy and shot, 1841. The rule of Rosas was now
one of tyranny and almost incessant bloodshed in Buenos Aires,
while his partisans, foremost amongst whom was General Ignacio
Oribe, endeavoured to exterminate the Unitarians throughout
the provinces. The scene of slaughter was extended to the
Banda Oriental by the attempt of Oribe, with the support of
Rosas, and of Justo José de Urquiza, governor of Entre Rios,
to establish himself as president of that republic (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Uruguay</a></span>),
where the existing government was hostile to Rosas and sheltered
all political refugees from the country under his despotic rule.
The siege of Montevideo led to a joint intervention of England
and France. Buenos Aires was blockaded by the combined
English and French fleets, September 1845, which landed a force
to open the passage up the Paraná to Paraguay, which had been
declared closed to foreigners by Rosas. A convention was signed
in 1849, which secured the free navigation of the Paraná and
the independence of the Banda Oriental. The downfall of Rosas
was at last brought about by the instrumentality of Justo José de
Urquiza, who as governor of Entre Rios, had for many years
been one of his strongest supporters. The breach between the
two men which led to open collision took place in 1846. The
first efforts of Urquiza to rouse the country against the oppressor
were unsuccessful, but in 1851 he concluded an alliance with
Brazil, to which Uruguay afterwards adhered. A large army
of twenty-four thousand men was collected at Montevideo, and
on the 8th of January 1852 the allied forces crossed the Paraná
and the road to Buenos Aires lay open before them. Rosas met
the allies at the head of a body of troops fully equal in numbers
to their own, but was crushingly routed, February 3rd, at Monte
Caseros, about 10 m. from the capital. The dictator fled for
refuge to the British legation, from whence he was conveyed on
board H.B.M.S. &ldquo;Locust,&rdquo; which carried him into exile.</p>

<p>A provisional government was formed under Urquiza, and the
Brazilian and Uruguayan troops withdrew. He summoned all
the provincial governors at San Nicolás in the province
of Buenos Aires, and on the 31st of May they proclaimed
<span class="sidenote">Urquiza president.</span>
a new constitution, with Urquiza as provisional
director of the Argentine nation. A constituent congress,
in which each province had equal representation, was duly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page471" id="page471"></a>471</span>
elected, and in order to provide against the predominance of
Buenos Aires, it was determined that Sante Fé should be the
place of session. But this did not suit the <i>porteños</i>, as the
people of Buenos Aires were called, and the province refused
to take any part in the congressional proceedings. But Urquiza
<span class="sidenote">Buenos Aires and the provinces.</span>
was a man of different temperament from Rosas, and
when he found that Buenos Aires refused to submit
to his authority, he declined to use force. The congress
had (May 1, 1853) appointed Urquiza president
of the confederation, and he established the seat of government
at Paraná. The province of Buenos Aires was recognized as an
independent state, and under the enlightened administration
of Doctor Obligado made rapid strides in commercial prosperity.
The two sections of the Argentine nation contrived to exist as
separate governments without an open breach of the peace until
1859, when the long-continued tension led to the outbreak of
hostilities. The army of the <i>porteños</i>, commanded by Colonel
Bartolomé Mitre, was defeated at Cepeda by the confederate
forces under Urquiza, and Buenos Aires agreed to re-enter the
confederation (November 11, 1859). Urquiza at this juncture
resigned the presidency, and Doctor Santiago Derqui was elected
president of the fourteen provinces with the seat of government
at Paraná; while Urquiza became once more governor of Entre
Rios, and Mitre was appointed governor of Buenos Aires.</p>

<p>The struggle for supremacy between Buenos Aires and the
provinces had, however, to be fought out, and hostilities once
more broke out in 1861. The armies of the opposing
parties, under Generals Mitre and Urquiza respectively,
<span class="sidenote">Mitre president.</span>
met at Pavón in the province of Santa Fé (September
17). The battle ended in the disastrous defeat of the provincial
forces; General Mitre used his victory in a spirit of moderation
and sincere patriotism. He was elected president of the
Argentine confederation and did his utmost to settle the questions
which had led to so many civil wars, on a permanent and sound
basis. The constitution of 1853 was maintained, but Buenos
Aires became the seat of federal government without ceasing
to be a provincial capital. Causes of friction still remained,
but they did not develop into open quarrels, for Mitre was content
to leave Urquiza in his province of Entre Rios, and the other
administrators (<i>caudillos</i>) in their several governments, a large
measure of autonomy, trusting that the position and growing
commercial importance of Buenos Aires would inevitably tend
to make the federal capital the real centre of power of the republic.
In 1865 the Argentines were forced into war with Paraguay
through the overbearing attitude of the president Francisco
Solano Lopez. The dictator of Paraguay had quarrelled with
Brazil for its intervention in the internal affairs of Uruguay,
<span class="sidenote">Paraguay war.</span>
and he demanded free passage for his troops across
the Argentine province of Corrientes. This Mitre
refused, and alliance was formed between Argentina,
Brazil and Uruguay, for joint action against Lopez. General
Mitre became commander-in-chief of the combined armies for
the invasion of Paraguay and was absent for several years in
the field. The struggle was severe and attended by heavy losses,
and it was not until 1870 that the Paraguayans were conquered,
Lopez killed, and peace concluded (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Paraguay</a></span>). Meanwhile,
disturbances had broken out in the interior of Argentina (1867),
which compelled Mitre to relinquish his command in Paraguay,
and to call back a large part of the Argentine forces to suppress
the insurrection. The rebels had hoped for assistance from
Urquiza, but the powerful governor of Entre Rios maintained the
peace in his province, which under his firm and beneficent rule
had greatly prospered, and the revolutionary movement was
quickly subdued.</p>

<p>In 1868 the term of General Mitre came to an end, and Doctor
Domingo Faustino Sarmiento, a native of San Juan, was quietly
elected to succeed him. His conduct of affairs was
broad-minded and upright, and was characterized
<span class="sidenote">Sarmiento president.</span>
by earnest efforts to promote education and to develop
the resources of the country. His period of office was marked
by the rapid advance of Buenos Aires in population and prosperity,
and by an expansion of trade that was unfortunately
accompanied by financial extravagance. The war with Paraguay
left a legacy of disputes concerning boundaries which almost
led to war between the two victorious allies, Argentina and
Brazil, but by the exertions of Mitre, who was sent at the close
of 1872 as special envoy to Rio, a settlement was arrived at and
friendly relations restored. The month of April 1870 saw an
insurrection in Entre Rios headed by the <i>caudillo</i>, Lopez Jordan.
Urquiza was assassinated, and the provincial legislature, through
fear, at once proclaimed Lopez Jordan governor. The federal
government refused to acknowledge the new governor, and
troops were despatched by Sarmiento against Entre Rios. The
contest lasted with varying success for more than a year, but
finally Lopez Jordan was completely defeated and driven into
exile.</p>

<p>The presidential election of 1874 resolved itself, as so often
before, into a struggle between the provincials and the <i>porteños</i>
(Buenos Aires). The candidate of the former, Dr
Nicolas Avellaneda, triumphed over General Mitre,
<span class="sidenote">Avellaneda president.</span>
not without suspicions of tampering with the returns;
and the unsuccessful party appealed to arms. The new
president, however, who was installed in office on the 12th
of October, took active steps to suppress the revolution, which
never assumed a really serious character. The government
troops gained two decisive victories over the insurgents under
Generals Mitre and Arredondo, and they were compelled to
surrender at discretion. But though peace was for a time
restored, the old causes of soreness and dissension remained
unappeased, and as the time for the next presidential election
began to draw near, it became more and more evident that a
critical struggle was at hand, and that the people of Buenos
Aires, supported by the province of Corrientes, were determined
to bring to an issue the question as to what position Buenos
Aires was to hold for the future with regard to the remaining
provinces of the confederation. It was evident that the president
intended to use all the influence which the party in power could
exercise, to secure the return of General Julio Roca, who had
distinguished himself in 1878 by a successful campaign against
the warlike Indian tribes bordering on the Andes. The <i>porteños</i>
on their part were determined to resist this policy to the utmost.
Mass meetings were held, and a committee was appointed for
the purpose of considering what action should be taken to
defeat the ambitious designs of the provincials.
<span class="sidenote">The Tiro Nacional.</span>
Under the direction of this committee, the association known
as the &ldquo;Tiro Nacional&rdquo; was formed, with the avowed
object of training the able-bodied citizens of Buenos
Aires in military exercises and creating a volunteer army, ready
for service if called upon, to withstand by force the pretensions
of their opponents. The establishment of the Tiro Nacional
was enthusiastically received by all classes in Buenos Aires, the
men turning out regularly to drill, and the women aiding the
movement by collecting subscriptions for the purpose of armament
and other necessaries. On the 13th of February 1880, the
minister of war, Dr Carlos Pellegrini, summoned the principal
officers connected with the Tiro Nacional, General Bartolomé
Mitre, his brother Emilio, Colonel Julio Campos, Colonel
Hilario Lagos and others, and warned them that as officers of
the national army they owed obedience to the national government,
and would be severely punished if concerned in any
revolutionary outbreak against the constituted authorities. The
reply to this threat was the immediate resignation of their commissions
by all the officers connected with the Tiro Nacional.
Two days later, the national government occupied, with a strong
force of infantry and artillery, the parade ground at Palermo
used by the Buenos Aires volunteers for drill purposes. A great
meeting of citizens was then called and marched through the
streets. President Avellaneda was frightened at the results of
his action, and to avoid a collision ordered the troops to be
withdrawn. Negotiations were now opened by the government
with the provincial authorities for the disarmament of the city
and province of Buenos Aires, but they led to nothing. Matters
became still further strained on account of the outrages committed
by the national troops, and such was the bitterness of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page472" id="page472"></a>472</span>
feeling developed between the two factions, that an appeal to
arms became inevitable.</p>

<p>In the month of June 1880, President Avellaneda and his
ministers left Buenos Aires, and this act was considered by the
<i>porteño</i> leaders equivalent to a declaration of war.
The national government and the twelve provinces
<span class="sidenote">Appeal to Arms.</span>
forming the Córdoba League, were ranged on one side;
the city and province of Buenos Aires and the province of
Corrientes on the other. The national troops were well armed
with Remington rifles, provided with abundant ammunition,
equipped with artillery and supported by the fleet. In the city
and province of Buenos Aires, plenty of volunteers offered their
services, and an army of some twenty-five thousand men was
quickly raised, but they were armed with old-fashioned weapons
and there was only a limited supply of ammunition. Feverish
attempts were made to remedy the lack of warlike stores, but
difficulty was experienced on account of the fleet blockading
the entrance to the river. After several skirmishes, the national
army commanded by General Roca, containing many troops
seasoned in Indian campaigns, assaulted the <i>porteños</i> posted
<span class="sidenote">Fall of Buenos Aires.</span>
before Buenos Aires, and after two days&rsquo; hard fighting
(20th and 21st July) forced its way into the town.
On 23rd July the surrender of the city was demanded
and obtained. The terms of the surrender were that
all the leaders of the revolution should be removed from positions
of authority, all government employees implicated in the
movement dismissed, and the force in the province and city
of Buenos Aires at once disarmed and disbanded. The power
of Buenos Aires was thus completely broken and at the mercy
of the Córdoba League. The <i>porteños</i> were no longer in a position
to nominate a candidate in opposition to General Julio Roca,
who was duly elected. He assumed office in October 1880.</p>

<p>Hitherto General Roca had been regarded only in his capacity
as a soldier, and not from the point of view of an administrator.
In the campaigns against the Indians in the south-west
of the province of Buenos Aires and the valley of
<span class="sidenote">Roca president.</span>
the Rio Negro he had gained much prestige; the victory
over Buenos Aires added to his fame, and secured his authority
in the outlying provincial centres. One of the first notable acts
of the Roca administration was to declare the city of Buenos
Aires the property of the national government. This separation
of the city from the province, and its federalization had been
one of the chief aims of the Córdoba League, and was the natural
consequence of the crushing defeat inflicted on the <i>porteños</i>. As
a sequel to this step, in 1884 the town of La Plata was declared
to be the capital of the province of Buenos Aires, and the provincial
administration was moved to that place. This federalization
of the capital has proved to be a most important factor
in binding together the different parts of the confederation, and
in promoting the evolution of an Argentine nation out of a
loosely cemented union of a number of semi-independent states.</p>

<p>Considering the circumstances in which General Roca assumed
office, it must be admitted that he showed great moderation
and used the practically absolute power that he possessed to
establish a strong central government, and to initiate a national
policy, which aimed at furthering the prosperity and development
of the whole country. He was able by the influence he
exerted to keep down the internal dissensions and insurrectionary
outbreaks which had so greatly impeded for many years the
development of the vast natural resources of the republic.
With this object he had promoted the extension of railways so
as to link the provinces with the great port of Buenos Aires,
and to provide at the same time facilities for the rapid despatch
of military forces to disturbed districts. Unfortunately the last
two years of Roca&rsquo;s term of office were marked by two grave
errors, which subsequently caused widespread suffering and
distress throughout the country. The first of these mistakes
was a measure making (January 1885) the currency inconvertible
for a period of two years. This act, which was only decided
upon after much hesitation, had a most deleterious effect upon
the national credit. The second was the nomination of Dr Miguel
Juarez Celman for the presidential term commencing in October
1886. The nomination was brought about by the Córdoba
clique, and Roca lacked the moral courage to oppose the decision
of this group, though he was well aware that Celman, who was
his brother-in-law, was neither intellectually nor morally fitted
for the post.</p>

<p>No sooner had President Juarez Celman come into power
towards the close of 1886, than the respectable portion of the
community began to feel alarmed at the methods
practised by the new president in his conduct of
<span class="sidenote">Celman president.</span>
public affairs. At first it was hoped that the influence
of General Roca would serve to check any serious extravagance
on the part of Celman. This hope, however, was doomed to
disappointment, and before many months had elapsed it was
clear that the president would listen to no prudent counsels
from Roca or from any one else. The men of the old Córdoba
League became dominant in all branches of the government,
and carpet-bagging politicians occupied every official post. In
their hurry to obtain wealth, this crowd of office-mongers from
the provinces lent themselves to all kinds of bribery and corruption.
The public credit was pledged at home and abroad to fill
the pockets of the adventurers, and the wildest excesses were
committed under the guise of administrative acts. What followed
in the second and third years of the Celman administration can
only adequately be described as a debauchery of the national
honour, of the national resources, of the rights of Argentines
as citizens of the republic. Buenos Aires was still prostrate
under the crushing blow of the misfortunes of 1880, and lacked
strength and power of organization necessary to raise any
effective protest against the proceedings of Celman and his
friends when the true character of these proceedings was first
understood. The conduct of public affairs, however, at length
became so scandalous, that action on the part of the more sober-minded
and conservative sections was seen to be absolutely
imperative if the country was to be saved from speedy and
certain ruin. In 1889 the association of the &ldquo;Union Civica&rdquo;
<span class="sidenote">The Union Civica.</span>
was founded, and the organization undertaken by
Dr Leandro Alem, Dr Aristobulo del Valle, Dr
Bernardo Irigoyen, Dr Vicente Lopez, Dr Lucio Lopez,
Dr Oscar Lilliedale and other leading citizens. The untiring
energy and zeal of Leandro Alem fitted him for being
the chief organizer of a movement into which he threw himself
heart and soul. Mass meetings were held in Buenos Aires, and
it fell specially to the lot of Dr del Valle, who was an able orator
as well as a sincere patriot, to expose the irresponsible and
corrupt character of the administration, and the terrible dangers
that threatened the republic through its reckless extravagance
and financial improvidence. Subsidiary clubs affiliated to the
central administration were formed throughout the length and
breadth of the country, and millions of leaflets and pamphlets
were distributed broadcast to explain the importance of the
movement. President Celman underrated the strength of the
new opposition, and relied upon his armed forces promptly to
suppress any signs of open hostility. No change was made in
official methods, and the condition of affairs drifted from bad
to worse, until the temper of the people, so long and so sorely
tried, showed plainly that the situation had become insufferable.
The Union Civica then decided to make a bold bid for freedom
by attempting forcibly to eject Celman and his clique from office.</p>

<p>On the night of the 26th of July 1890 the Union Civica called
its members to arms. It was joined by some regiments of the
regular army and received the support of the fleet. Barricades
were thrown up in the principal streets, and the surrounding
houses were occupied by the insurgents. Two days of desultory
street fighting ensued, during which the fleet began to bombard
the city, but was compelled to desist by the interference of
foreign men-of-war, on the ground that the bombardment was
causing unnecessary damage to the life and property of non-combatants.
A suspension of hostilities then took place, and
negotiations were opened between the contending parties.
Celman, acting upon the advice of General Roca, who recognized
the strength of public opinion in the outbreak, placed his resignation
in the hands of congress on the 31st of July. A scene of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page473" id="page473"></a>473</span>
intense enthusiasm followed, and Buenos Aires was <i>en fête</i> for
the following three days. The vice-president of the confederation,
Carlos Pellegrini, who had been minister of war under
presidents Avellaneda and Roca and had had much administrative
experience, succeeded without opposition to the vacant
post.</p>

<p>Much satisfaction was shown in Europe at the fall of President
Celman, for investors had suffered heavily by the way in which
the resources of Argentina had been dissipated by
a corrupt government, and hopes were entertained
<span class="sidenote">Pellegrini president.</span>
that the uprising of public opinion against his financial
methods signified a more honest conduct of the national
affairs in the future. Great expectations were entertained
of the ability of President Pellegrini to establish a sound
administration, and he succeeded in forming a ministry which
gave general satisfaction throughout the country. General
Roca was induced to undertake the duties of minister of the
interior, and his influence in the provinces was sufficient to
check any attempts to stir up disturbances at Córdoba or elsewhere.
The most onerous post of all, that of minister of finance,
was confided to Dr Vicente Lopez, who, though he was not of
marked financial ability, was at least a man of untiring industry
and of a personal integrity that was above suspicion. But the
economic and financial situation was one of almost hopeless
embarrassment and confusion, and Pellegrini proved himself
incapable of grappling with it. Instead of facing the difficulties,
the president preferred to put off the day of reckoning by
flooding the country with inconvertible notes, with the result
that the financial crisis became more and more aggravated.
Through the rapid depreciation of Argentine credit, the great
firm of Baring Brothers, the financial agents of the government
in London, became so heavily involved that they were forced
into liquidation, November 1890. The consequences of this
catastrophe were felt far and wide, and in the spring of 1891
both the Banco Nacional and the Banco de la provincia de
Buenos Aires were unable to meet their obligations. Amidst
this sea of financial troubles the government drifted helplessly
on, without showing any inclination or capacity to initiate a
strong policy of reform in the methods of administration which
had done so much to ruin the country.</p>

<p>It is little wonder that, in these circumstances, the choice
of a successor to Pellegrini, whose term of office expired in 1892,
should have been felt to possess peculiar importance. General
Bartolomé Mitre was proposed by the <i>porteños</i> as their candidate.
He had been absent from Argentina on a journey to
Europe, and on his return in April 1891, a popular reception
was given to him at which 50,000 persons attended. A petition
was presented to him begging him to be a candidate for the
presidency, and with some reluctance the veteran leader gave
his consent. His partisans, however, found themselves confronted
by a compact provincial party, who proposed to put
forward the other strong man of the republic, General Roca,
to oppose him. But the two generals were equally averse to a
contest <i>à outrance</i>, which could only end in civil war. They
met accordingly at a conference known as <i>El Acuerdo</i>, and it
was arranged that both should withdraw, and that a non-party
candidate should be selected who should receive the support
of them both. The choice fell upon Dr Saenz Peña, a judge of
the supreme court, and a man universally respected, who had
never taken any part in political life. This compact aroused
the bitter enmity of Dr Leandro Alem, who did his utmost to
stir up the Union Civica to a campaign against the neutral
candidate. Finding that the more conservative section of the
union would not follow him, Alem formed a new association to
which he gave the name of Union Civica Radical. Such was his
energy, that soon a network of branches of the Union Civica
Radical was organized throughout the republic, and Dr Bernardo
Irigoyen was put forward as a rival candidate to Dr Saenz
Peña. But Alem was not content with constitutional opposition
to the Acuerdo, and his movement soon assumed the character
of a revolutionary propaganda against the national government.
His violence gave Pellegrini the opportunity of taking active
steps to preserve the peace. In April 1892 Alem and his chief
colleagues were arrested and sent into exile.</p>

<p>In the following month (May), the presidential elections were
held; Dr Saenz Peña was declared duly elected, and Dr José
Uriburu, the minister in Chile, was chosen as vice-president.</p>

<p>The idea of Dr Saenz Peña was to conduct the government
on common sense and non-partisan lines, in fact to translate
into practical politics the principles which underlay
the compromise of the Acuerdo. He was a straightforward
<span class="sidenote">Saenz Peña president.</span>
and honourable man, who tried his best to do
his duty in a position that had been forced upon him,
and was in no sense of the word his own seeking. No sooner,
however, was he installed in office than difficulties began to crop
up on all sides, and he quickly discovered that to attempt to
govern without the aid of a majority in congress was practically
impossible. He had had no experience of political life, and he
refused to create the support he needed by using his presidential
prerogative to build up a political majority. Obstruction met
his well-meant efforts to promote the general good, and before
twelve months of the presidential term had run public affairs
were at a deadlock. Dr Alem, who had been permitted to return
from exile, was not slow to profit by the occasion. Embittered
by his treatment in 1892, he openly preached the advisability
of an armed rising to overthrow the existing administration.
Public opinion had been outraged by the immunity with which
the governors of certain provinces, and more particularly Dr
Julio Costa, the governor of the province of Buenos Aires,
had been allowed to maintain local forces, by the aid of which
they exacted the payment of illegal taxes and exercised other
acts of injustice and oppression. A number of officers of the army
and navy agreed to lend assistance to a revolutionary outbreak,
and towards the end of July 1893 matters came to a head.
The population of Buenos Aires assembled in armed bodies with
the avowed intention of ejecting the governor from office, and
electing in his stead a man who would give them a just administration.
The president was for some time in doubt whether he
had any right to intervene in provincial affairs, but eventually
troops were despatched to La Plata. There was no serious
fighting. Negotiations were soon opened which quickly led to
the resignation of Costa, and the return of the insurgents to
their homes. While these disturbances were taking place in
the province of Buenos Aires, another revolutionary rising was
in progress in Santa Fé. Here the efforts of Dr Alem succeeded
in supplying a large body of rebels with arms and ammunition,
and he was able, by a bold attack, to seize the town of
Rosario and there establish the revolutionary headquarters. This
capture so alarmed the national government that a force was
sent under the command of Roca to put down the insurrection.
The revolt speedily collapsed before this redoubtable commander,
and Alem and the other leaders surrendered. They were sentenced
to banishment in Staten Island at the pleasure of the
federal government.</p>

<p>But the suppression of disorder did not relieve the tension
between the congress and the executive. During the whole
of the 1894 session, the attitude of senators and deputies alike
was one of pronounced hostility to the president. All his acts
were opposed, legislation was at a standstill and every effort
was made to force Dr Saenz Peña to resign. But although he experienced
the utmost difficulty in forming a cabinet, the president
was obstinate in his determination to retain office without
identifying himself with any party. A definite issue was therefore
sought by the congress on which to join battle, and it arose out
of the death sentences which had been pronounced on certain
naval and military officers who had been implicated in the
Santa Fé outbreak. The president had made up his mind that
the sentence must be carried out; the congress by a great
majority were resolved not to permit the death penalty to be
inflicted. It was a one-sided struggle, for without the consent
of the congress the president could not raise any money for
supplies, and congress refused to vote the budget. But heavy
expenses had been incurred in putting down revolutionary
movements in various parts of the provinces, and war with Chile
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page474" id="page474"></a>474</span>
was threatened upon the question of a dispute concerning the
boundaries between the two republics. In January 1895 a
special session of congress was summoned to take into consideration
the financial proposals of the government, which
included an increase in the naval and military estimates. Congress,
however, had now got their opportunity, and they used
the time of national stress to bring increased pressure to bear
upon the president. On the 21st of January Dr Saenz Peña
at last perceived that his position was untenable, and he handed
in his resignation. It was accepted at once by the chambers,
and the vice-president, Dr José Uriburu, became president of
the republic for the three years and nine months of Peña&rsquo;s term
which remained unexpired.</p>

<p>Uriburu was neither a politician nor a statesman, but had
spent the greater portion of his life abroad in the diplomatic
service. His knowledge of foreign affairs was, however,
peculiarly useful at a juncture when boundary questions
<span class="sidenote">Uriburu President.</span>
were the subjects that chiefly attracted public
attention. After disputes with Brazil, extending over fifteen
years, about the territory of &ldquo;Misiones,&rdquo; the matter had
been submitted to the arbitration of the president of the
United States. In March 1895 President Cleveland gave his
decision, which was wholly favourable to the contention of
Brazil. The Argentine government, though disappointed at
the result, accepted the award loyally. The boundary dispute
with Chile, to which reference has already been made, was of
a more serious character. The dispute was of old standing.
Already in 1884 a protocol had been signed between the contending
parties, by which it was agreed that the frontier
should follow the line where &ldquo;the highest peaks of the Andine
ranges divide the watershed.&rdquo; This definition unfortunately
ignored the fact that the Andes do not run from north to south
in one continuous line, but are separated into cordilleras with
valleys between them, and covering in their total breadth a
considerable extent of country. Difference of opinion, therefore,
arose as to the interpretation of the protocol, the Argentines
insisting that the boundary should run from highest peak to
highest peak, the Chileans that it should follow the highest
points of the watershed. The quarrel at length became acute,
and on both sides the populace clamoured from time to time
for an appeal to arms, and the resources of both countries were
squandered in military and naval preparations for a struggle.
Nevertheless despite these obstacles, President Uriburu did something
during his term of office to relieve the nation&rsquo;s financial
difficulties. In 1896 a bill was passed by congress, which
authorized the state by the issue of national bonds to assume
the provincial external indebtedness. This proof of the desire
of the Argentine government to meet honestly all its obligations
did much to restore its credit abroad. Uriburu found in 1897
the financial position so far improved that he was able to resume
cash payments on the entire foreign debt.</p>

<p>In 1898 there was another presidential election. Public
opinion, excited by the prospect of a war with Chile, naturally
supported the candidature of General Roca, and he
was elected without opposition (12th October 1898).
<span class="sidenote">Roca President.</span>
The first question which he had to handle was the
Chilean boundary dispute. During the last months of President
Uriburu&rsquo;s administration, matters had reached a climax, especially
in connexion with the delimitation in a district known as
the Puña de Atacama. In August an ultimatum was received
from Chile demanding arbitration. After some hesitation, on
the advice of Roca the Argentines agreed to the demand, and
peace was maintained. The principle of arbitration being
accepted, the conditions were quickly arranged. The question
of the Puña de Atacama was referred to a tribunal composed
of the United States minister to Argentina and of one Argentine
and one Chilean delegate; that of the southern frontier in
Patagonia to the British crown. One of the first steps of President
Roca, after his accession to office, was to arrange a meeting
with the president of Chile at the Straits of Magellan. At their
conference all difficulties were discussed and settled, and an
undertaking was given on both sides to put a stop to warlike
preparations. The decision of the representative of the United
States was given in April 1899. Although the Chileans professed
dissatisfaction, no active opposition was raised, and the
terms were duly ratified. In his message to congress, on the
1st of May 1899, General Roca spoke strongly of the immediate
necessity of a reform in the methods of administering justice,
the expediency of a revision of the electoral law, and the imperative
need of a reconstruction of the department of public
instruction. The administration of justice, he declared, had
fallen to so low an ebb as to be practically non-existent. By
the powerful influence of the president, government measures
were sanctioned by the legislature dealing with the abuses
which had been condemned. On the 31st of August of the same
year a series of proposals upon the currency question was
submitted to congress by the president, whose real object was to
counteract the too rapid appreciation of the inconvertible paper
money. The official value of the dollar was fixed at 44 cents
gold for all government purposes. The violent fluctuations
in the value of the paper dollar, which caused so much damage
to trade and industry, were thus checked. In October 1900
Dr Manuel Campos Salles, president of Brazil, paid a visit to
Buenos Aires, and was received with great demonstrations
of friendliness. The aggressive attitude of Chile towards Bolivia
was causing considerable anxiety, and Argentina and Brazil
wished to show that they were united in opposing a policy which
aimed at acquiring an extension of territory by force of arms.
The feeling of enmity between Chile and Argentina was indeed
anything but extinct. The delay of the arbitration tribunal
in London in giving its decision in the matter of the disputed
boundary in Patagonia led to a crop of wild rumours being
disseminated, and to a revival of animosity between the two
peoples. In December 1901 warlike preparations were being
carried on in both states, and the outbreak of active hostilities
appeared to be imminent. At the critical moment the British
government, urged to move in the matter by the British residents
in both countries, who feared that war would mean the financial
ruin of both Chile and Argentina, used its utmost influence
both at Santiago and Buenos Aires to allay the misunderstandings;
and negotiations were set on foot which ended in
a treaty for the cessation of further armaments being signed,
June 1902. The award of King Edward VII. upon the delimitation
of the boundary was given a few months later,
and was received without controversy and ratified by both
governments.</p>

<p>To the calm resourcefulness and level-headedness of President
Roca at a very difficult and critical juncture must be largely
ascribed the preservation of peace, and the permanent removal
of a dispute that had aroused so much irritation. His term
<span class="sidenote">Quintana and Alcorta Presidents.</span>
of office came to an end in 1904, when Dr Manuel Quintana
was elected president and Dr José Figueroa Alcorta
vice-president, both having Roca&rsquo;s support. Dr
Quintana at the time of his election was sixty-four
years of age. He proved a hard-working progressive
president, who did much for the development of communications
and the opening up of the interior of the country. He died
amidst general regret in March 1906, and was succeeded by
Dr Alcorta for the remaining years of his term.</p>

<p><span class="bold">ARGENTITE,<a name="ar45" id="ar45"></a></span> a mineral which belongs to the galena group,
and is cubic silver sulphide (Ag<span class="su">2</span>S). It is occasionally found as uneven
cubes and octahedra, but more often as dendritic or earthy
masses, with a blackish lead-grey colour and metallic lustre.
The cubic cleavage, which is so prominent a feature in galena,
is here present only in traces. The mineral is perfectly sectile
and has a shining streak; hardness 2.5, specific gravity 7.3. It
occurs in mineral veins, and when found in large masses, as in
Mexico and in the Comstock lode in Nevada, it forms an important
ore of silver. The mineral was mentioned so long ago
as 1529 by G. Agricola, but the name argentite (from the Lat.
<i>argentum</i>, &ldquo;silver&rdquo;) was not used till 1845 and is due to W.
von Haidinger. Old names for the species are Glaserz, silver-glance
and vitreous silver. A cupriferous variety, from Jalpa in
Tabasco, Mexico, is known as jalpaite. Acanthite is a supposed
dimorphous form, crystallizing in the orthorhombic system,

when its depth exceeds 3 ft. its great rapidity makes it a serious
obstacle to travellers. In its lower course it is much used for
irrigation, and the valley is cultivated and populous; yet the
water is said to be somewhat brackish. It is doubtful whether
the ancient Arachotus is to be identified with the Arghandab or
with its chief confluent the Tarnak, which joins it on the left
about 30 m. S.W. of Kandahar. The two rivers run nearly
parallel, inclosing the backbone of the Ghilzai plateau. The
Tarnak is much the shorter (length about 200 m.) and less copious.
The ruins at Ulân Robât, supposed to represent the city Arachosia,
are in its basin; and the lake known as Ab-i-Istâda, the
most probable representative of Lake Arachotus, is near the
head of the Tarnak, though not communicating with it. The
Tarnak is dammed for irrigation at intervals, and in the hot
season almost exhausted. There is a good deal of cultivation
along the river, but few villages. The high road from Kabul
to Kandahar passes this way (another reason for supposing the
Tarnak to be Arachotus), and the people live off the road to
avoid the onerous duties of hospitality.</p>

<p><span class="bold">ARGON<a name="ar50" id="ar50"></a></span> (from the Gr. <span class="grk" title="a-">&#7936;-</span>, privative, and <span class="grk" title="ergon">&#7954;&#961;&#947;&#959;&#957;</span>, work; hence
meaning &ldquo;inert&rdquo;), a gaseous constituent of atmospheric air.
For more than a hundred years before 1894 it had been supposed
that the composition of the atmosphere was thoroughly known.
Beyond variable quantities of moisture and traces of carbonic
acid, hydrogen, ammonia, &amp;c., the only constituents recognized
were nitrogen and oxygen. The analysis of air was conducted
by determining the amount of oxygen present and assuming
the remainder to be nitrogen. Since the time of Henry
Cavendish no one seemed even to have asked the question
whether the residue was, in truth, all capable of conversion
into nitric acid.</p>

<p>The manner in which this condition of complacent ignorance
came to be disturbed is instructive. Observations undertaken
mainly in the interest of Prout&rsquo;s law, and extending over many
years, had been conducted to determine afresh the densities
of the principal gases&mdash;hydrogen, oxygen and nitrogen. In
the latter case, the first preparations were according to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page476" id="page476"></a>476</span>
convenient method devised by Vernon Harcourt, in which air
charged with ammonia is passed over red-hot copper. Under
the influence of the heat the atmospheric oxygen, unites with
the hydrogen of the ammonia, and when the excess of the latter
is removed with sulphuric acid, the gas properly desiccated
should be pure nitrogen, derived in part from the ammonia, but
principally from the air. A few concordant determinations of
density having been effected, the question was at first regarded
as disposed of, until the thought occurred that it might be desirable
to try also the more usual method of preparation in which
the oxygen is removed by actual oxidation of copper without
the aid of ammonia. Determinations made thus were equally
concordant among themselves, but the resulting density was
about <span class="spp">1</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">1000</span> part greater than that found by Harcourt&rsquo;s method
(Rayleigh, <i>Nature</i>, vol. xlvi. p. 512, 1892). Subsequently when
<i>oxygen</i> was substituted for air in the first method, so that all
(instead of about one-seventh part) of the nitrogen was derived
from ammonia, the difference rose to ½%. Further experiment
only brought out more clearly the diversity of the gases hitherto
assumed to be identical. Whatever were the means employed
to rid air of accompanying oxygen, a uniform value of the density
was arrived at, and this value was ½% greater than that appertaining
to nitrogen extracted from compounds such as nitrous
oxide, ammonia and ammonium nitrite. No impurity, consisting
of any known substance, could be discovered capable of
explaining an excessive weight in the one case, or a deficiency
in the other. Storage for eight months did not disturb the
density of the chemically extracted gas, nor had the silent
electric discharge any influence upon either quality. (&ldquo;On an
Anomaly encountered in determining the Density of Nitrogen
Gas,&rdquo; <i>Proc. Roy. Soc.</i>, April 1894.)</p>

<p>At this stage it became clear that the complication depended
upon some hitherto unknown body, and probability inclined
to the existence of a gas in the atmosphere heavier than nitrogen,
and remaining unacted upon during the removal of the oxygen&mdash;a
conclusion afterwards fully established by Lord Rayleigh
and Sir William Ramsay. The question which now pressed
was as to the character of the evidence for the universally
accepted view that the so-called nitrogen of the atmosphere
was all of one kind, that the nitrogen of the air was the same
as the nitrogen of nitre. Reference to Cavendish showed that
he had already raised this question in the most distinct manner,
and indeed, to a certain extent, resolved it. In his memoir of
1785 he writes:&mdash;</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>&ldquo;As far as the experiments hitherto published extend, we scarcely
know more of the phlogisticated part of our atmosphere than that
it is not diminished by lime-water, caustic alkalies, or nitrous air;
that it is unfit to support fire or maintain life in animals; and that
its specific gravity is not much less than that of common air; so
that, though the nitrous acid, by being united to phlogiston, is converted
into air possessed of these properties, and consequently,
though it was reasonable to suppose, that part at least of the phlogisticated
air of the atmosphere consists of this acid united to
phlogiston, yet it may fairly be doubted whether the whole is of this
kind, or whether there are not in reality many different substances
confounded together by us under the name of phlogisticated air. I
therefore made an experiment to determine whether the whole of a
given portion of the phlogisticated air of the atmosphere could be
reduced to nitrous acid, or whether there was not a part of a different
nature to the rest which would refuse to undergo that change. The
foregoing experiments indeed, in some measure, decided this point,
as much the greatest part of air let up into the tube lost its elasticity;
yet, as some remained unabsorbed, it did not appear for certain
whether that was of the same nature as the rest or not. For this
purpose I diminished a similar mixture of dephlogisticated [oxygen]
and common air, in the same manner as before [by sparks over
alkali], till it was reduced to a small part of its original bulk. I then,
in order to decompound as much as I could of the phlogisticated air
[nitrogen] which remained in the tube, added some dephlogisticated
air to it and continued the spark until no further diminution took
place. Having by these means condensed as much as I could of the
phlogisticated air, I let up some solution of liver of sulphur to absorb
the dephlogisticated air; after which only a small bubble of air
remained unabsorbed, which certainly was not more than <span class="spp">1</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">120</span> of
the bulk of the dephlogisticated air let up into the tube; so that,
if there be any part of the dephlogisticated air of our atmosphere
which differs from the rest, and cannot be reduced to nitrous acid,
we may safely conclude that it is not more than <span class="spp">1</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">120</span> part of the
whole.&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<p>Although, as was natural, Cavendish was satisfied with his
result, and does not decide whether the small residue was genuine,
it is probable that his residue was really of a different kind from
the main bulk of the &ldquo;phlogisticated air,&rdquo; and contained the
gas afterwards named argon.</p>

<p>The announcement to the British Association in 1894 by
Rayleigh and Ramsay of a new gas in the atmosphere was
received with a good deal of scepticism. Some doubted the
discovery of a new gas altogether, while others denied that it
was present in the atmosphere. Yet there was nothing inconsistent
with any previously ascertained fact in the asserted
presence of 1% of a non-oxidizable gas about half as heavy again
as nitrogen. The nearest approach to a difficulty lay in the
behaviour of liquid air, from which it was supposed, as the event
proved erroneously, that such a constituent would separate
itself in the solid form. The evidence of the existence of a new
gas (named Argon on account of its chemical inertness), and a
statement of many of its properties, were communicated to the
Royal Society (see <i>Phil. Trans.</i> clxxxvi. p. 187) by the discoverers
in January 1895. The isolation of
the new substance by removal of nitrogen
from air was effected by two distinct
methods. Of these the first is merely a
development of that of Cavendish. The
gases were contained in a test-tube A (fig. 1)
standing over a large quantity of
weak alkali B, and the current was conveyed
in wires insulated by U-shaped glass
tubes CC passing through the liquid and
round the mouth of the test-tube. The
inner platinum ends DD of the wire may
be sealed into the glass insulating tubes,
but reliance should not be placed upon
these sealings. In order to secure tightness
in spite of cracks, mercury was placed
in the bends. With a battery of five
Grove cells and a Ruhmkorff coil of
medium size, a somewhat short spark, or
arc, of about 5 mm. was found to be more
favourable than a longer one. When the
mixed gases were in the right proportion,
the rate of absorption was about 30 c.c. per hour, about
thirty times as fast as Cavendish could work with the electrical
machine of his day. Where it is available, an alternating
electric current is much superior to a battery and break.
This combination, introduced by W. Spottiswoode, allows the
absorption in the apparatus of fig. 1 to be raised to about 80 c.c.
per hour, and the method is very convenient for the purification
of small quantities of argon and for determinations of the amount
present in various samples of gas, <i>e.g.</i> in the gases expelled from
solution in water. A convenient adjunct to this apparatus
is a small voltameter, with the aid of which oxygen or hydrogen
can be introduced at pleasure. The gradual elimination of the
nitrogen is tested at a moment&rsquo;s notice with a miniature spectroscope.
For this purpose a small Leyden jar is connected as usual
to the secondary terminals, and if necessary the force of the
discharge is moderated by the insertion of resistance in the
primary circuit. When with a fairly wide slit the yellow line is
no longer visible, the residual nitrogen may be considered to have
fallen below 2 or 3%. During this stage the oxygen should be
in considerable excess. When the yellow line of nitrogen has
disappeared, and no further contraction seems to be in progress,
the oxygen maybe removed by cautious introduction of hydrogen.
The spectrum may now be further examined with a more powerful
instrument. The most conspicuous group in the argon spectrum
at atmospheric pressure is that first recorded by A. Schuster
(fig. 2). Water vapour and excess of oxygen in moderation do
not interfere seriously with its visibility. It is of interest to
note that the argon spectrum may be fully developed by operating
upon a miniature scale, starting with only 5 c.c. of air (<i>Phil.
Mag.</i> vol. i. p. 103, 1901).</p>

<p>The development of Cavendish&rsquo;s method upon a large scale
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page477" id="page477"></a>477</span>
involves arrangements different from what would at first be
expected. The transformer working from a public supply should
give about 6000 volts on open circuit, although when the electric
flame is established the voltage on the platinums is only from
1600 to 2000. No sufficient advantage is attained by raising
the pressure of the gases above atmosphere, but a capacious
vessel is necessary. This may consist of a glass sphere of 50 litres&rsquo;
capacity, into the neck of which, presented downwards, the
necessary tubes are fitted. The whole of the interior surface is
washed with a fountain of alkali, kept in circulation by means
of a small centrifugal pump. In this apparatus, and with about
one horse-power utilized at the transformer, the absorption of
gas is 21 litres per hour (&ldquo;The Oxidation of Nitrogen Gas,&rdquo;
<i>Trans. Chem. Soc.</i>, 1897).</p>

<p>In one experiment, specially undertaken for the sake of
measurement, the total air employed was 9250 c.c., and the
oxygen consumed, manipulated with the aid of partially de-aërated
water, amounted to 10,820 c.c. The oxygen contained
in the air would be 1942 c.c.; so that the quantities of atmospheric
nitrogen and of total oxygen which enter into combination
would be 7308 c.c. and 12,762 c.c. respectively. This corresponds
to N + 1.75 O, the oxygen being decidedly in excess of the proportion
required to form nitrous acid. The argon ultimately
found was 75.0 c.c., or a little more than 1% of the atmospheric
nitrogen used. A subsequent determination over mercury by
A.M. Kellas (<i>Proc. Roy. Soc.</i> lix. p. 66, 1895) gave 1.186 c.c.
as the amount of argon present in 100 c.c. of mixed atmospheric
nitrogen and argon. In the earlier stages of the inquiry, when
it was important to meet the doubts which had been expressed
as to the presence of the new gas in the atmosphere, blank
experiments were executed in which air was replaced by nitrogen
from ammonium nitrite. The residual argon, derived doubtless
from the water used to manipulate the gases, was but a small
fraction of what would have been obtained from a corresponding
quantity of air.</p>

<p>The other method by which nitrogen may be absorbed on a
considerable scale is by the aid of magnesium. The metal in
the form of thin turnings is charged into hard glass or iron tubes
heated to a full red in a combustion furnace. Into this air,
previously deprived of oxygen by red-hot copper and thoroughly
dried, is led in a continuous stream. At this temperature the
nitrogen combines with the magnesium, and thus the argon is
concentrated. A still more potent absorption is afforded by
calcium prepared <i>in situ</i> by heating a mixture of magnesium
dust with thoroughly dehydrated quick-lime. The density of
argon, prepared and purified by magnesium, was found by
Sir William Ramsay to be 19.941 on the O = 16 scale. The
volume actually weighed was 163 c.c. Subsequently large-scale
operations with the same apparatus as had been used for the
principal gases gave an almost identical result (19.940) for argon
prepared with oxygen.</p>

<p>Argon is soluble in water at 12° C. to about 4.0%, that is,
it is about 2½ times more soluble than nitrogen. We should
thus expect to find it in increased proportion in the dissolved
gases of rain-water. Experiment has confirmed this anticipation.
The weight of a mixture of argon and nitrogen prepared from the
dissolved gases showed an excess of 24 mg. over the weight of true
nitrogen, the corresponding excess for the atmospheric mixture
being only 11 mg. Argon is contained in the gases liberated by
many thermal springs, but not in special quantity. The gas
collected from the King&rsquo;s Spring at Bath gave only ½%, <i>i.e.</i> half
the atmospheric proportion.</p>

<p>The most remarkable physical property of argon relates to
the constant known as the ratio of specific heats. When a gas
is warmed one degree, the heat which must be supplied depends
upon whether the operation is conducted at a constant volume
or at a constant pressure, being greater in the latter case. The
ratio of specific heats of the principal gases is 1.4, which, according
to the kinetic theory, is an indication that an important
fraction of the energy absorbed is devoted to rotation or vibration.
If, as for Boscovitch points, the whole energy is translatory,
the ratio of specific heats must be 1.67. This is precisely the
number found from the velocity of sound in argon as determined
by Kundt&rsquo;s method, and it leaves no room for any sensible
energy of rotatory or vibrational motion. The same value had
previously been found for mercury vapour by Kundt and
Warburg, and had been regarded as confirmatory of the monatomic
character attributed on chemical grounds to the mercury
molecule. It may be added that helium has the same character
as argon in respect of specific heats (Ramsay, <i>Proc. Roy. Soc.</i>
l. p. 86, 1895).</p>

<p>The refractivity of argon is .961 of that of air. This low
refractivity is noteworthy as strongly antagonistic to the view
at one time favoured by eminent chemists that argon was a
condensed form of nitrogen represented by N<span class="su">3</span>. The viscosity of
argon is 1.21, referred to air, somewhat higher than for oxygen,
which stands at the head of the list of the principal gases (&ldquo;On
some Physical Properties of Argon and Helium,&rdquo; <i>Proc. Roy.
Soc.</i> vol. lix. p. 198, 1896).</p>

<p>The spectrum shows remarkable peculiarities. According to
circumstances, the colour of the light obtained from a Plücker
vacuum tube changes &ldquo;from red to a rich steel blue,&rdquo; to use the
words of Crookes, who first described the phenomenon. A third
spectrum is distinguished by J.M. Eder and Edward Valenta.
The red spectrum is obtained at moderately low pressures
(5 mm.) by the use of a Ruhmkorff coil without a jar or air-gap.
The red lines at 7056 and 6965 (Crookes) are characteristic. The
blue spectrum is best seen at a somewhat lower pressure (1 mm.
to 2.5 mm.), and usually requires a Leyden jar to be connected
to the secondary terminals. In some conditions very small
causes effect a transition from the one spectrum to the other.
The course of electrical events attending the operation of a
Ruhmkorff coil being extremely complicated, special interest
attaches to some experiments conducted by John Trowbridge
and T.W. Richards, in which the source of power was a secondary
battery of 5000 cells. At a pressure of 1 mm. the red glow of
argon was readily obtained with a voltage of 2000, but not with
much less. After the discharge was once started, the difference
of potentials at the terminals of the tube varied from 630 volts
upwards.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>The introduction of a capacity between the terminals of the
Geissler tube, for example two plates of metal 1600 sq. cm. in area
separated by a glass plate 1 cm. thick, made no difference in the
red glow so long as the connexions were good and the condenser was
quiet. As soon as a spark-gap was introduced, or the condenser
began to emit the humming sound peculiar to it, the beautiful blue
glow so characteristic of argon immediately appeared. (<i>Phil. Mag.</i>
xliii. p. 77, 1897.)</p>
</div>

<p>The behaviour of argon at low temperatures was investigated
by K.S. Olszewski (<i>Phil. Trans.</i>, 1895, p. 253). The following
results are extracted from the table given by him:&mdash;</p>

</table>

<p>The smallness of the interval between the boiling and freezing
points is noteworthy.</p>

<p>From the manner of its preparation it was clear at an early
stage that argon would not combine with magnesium or calcium
at a red heat, nor under the influence of the electric discharge
with oxygen, hydrogen or nitrogen. Numerous other, attempts
to induce combination also failed. Nor does it appear that any
well-defined compound of argon has yet been prepared. It was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page478" id="page478"></a>478</span>
found, however, by M.P.E. Berthelot that under the influence
of the silent electric discharge, a mixture of benzene vapour
and argon underwent contraction, with formation of a gummy
product from which the argon could be recovered.</p>

<p>The facts detailed in the original memoir led to the conclusion
that argon was an element or a mixture of elements, but the
question between these alternatives was left open. The behaviour
on liquefaction, however, seemed to prove that in the latter
case either the proportion of the subordinate constituents
was small, or else that the various constituents were but little
contrasted. An attempt, somewhat later, by Ramsay and
J. Norman Collie to separate argon by diffusion into two parts,
which should have different densities or refractivities, led to
no distinct effect. More recently Ramsay and M.W. Travers
have obtained evidence of the existence in the atmosphere of
three new gases, besides helium, to which have been assigned
the names of neon, krypton and xenon. These gases agree with
argon in respect of the ratio of the specific heats and in being
non-oxidizable under the electric spark. As originally defined,
argon included small proportions of these gases, but it is now
preferable to limit the name to the principal constituent and to
regard the newer gases as &ldquo;companions of argon.&rdquo; The physical
constants associated with the name will scarcely be changed,
since the proportion of the &ldquo;companions&rdquo; is so small. Sir
William Ramsay considers that probably the volume of all of
them taken together does not exceed <span class="spp">1</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">400</span>th part of that of the
argon. The physical properties of these gases are given in the

Being less volatile than nitrogen, argon accumulates relatively

<p><span class="bold">ARGONAUTS<a name="ar51" id="ar51"></a></span> (<span class="grk" title="Argonautai">&#902;&#961;&#947;&#959;&#957;&#945;&#8166;&#964;&#945;&#953;</span>, the sailors of the &ldquo;Argo&rdquo;), in Greek
legend a band of heroes who took part in the Argonautic expedition
under the command of Jason, to fetch the golden fleece.
This task had been imposed on Jason by his uncle Pelias (<i>q.v.</i>),
who had usurped the throne of Iolcus in Thessaly, which
rightfully belonged to Jason&rsquo;s father Aeson. The story of the
fleece was as follows. Jason&rsquo;s uncle Athamas had two children,
Phrixus and Helle, by his wife Nephele, the cloud goddess.
But after a time he became enamoured of Ino, the daughter of
Cadmus, and neglected Nephele, who disappeared in anger.
Ino, who hated the children of Nephele, persuaded Athamas,
by means of a false oracle, to offer Phrixus as a sacrifice, as the
only means of alleviating a famine which she herself had caused
by ordering the grain to be secretly roasted before it was sown.
But before the sacrifice the shade of Nephele appeared to Phrixus,
bringing a ram with a golden fleece on which he and his sister
Helle endeavoured to escape over the sea. Helle fell off and was
drowned in the strait, which after her was called the Hellespont.
Phrixus, however, reached the other side in safety, and proceeding
by land to Aea in Colchis on the farther shore of the Euxine Sea,
sacrificed the ram, and hung up its fleece in the grove of Ares,
where it was guarded by a sleepless dragon.</p>

<p>Jason, having undertaken the quest of the fleece, called upon
the noblest heroes of Greece to take part in the expedition.
According to the original story, the crew consisted of the chief
members of Jason&rsquo;s own race, the Minyae. But when the legend
became common property, other and better-known heroes were
added to their number&mdash;Orpheus, Castor and Polydeuces
(Pollux), Zetes and Calais, the winged sons of Boreas, Meleager,
Theseus, Heracles. The crew was supposed to consist of fifty,
agreeing in number with the fifty oars of the &ldquo;Argo,&rdquo; so called
from its builder Argos, the son of Phrixus, or from <span class="grk" title="argos">&#7936;&#961;&#947;&#972;&#962;</span>
(swift).  It was a larger vessel than had ever been seen before, built of
pine-wood that never rotted from Mount Pelion. The goddess
Athena herself superintended its construction, and inserted in
the prow a piece of oak from Dodona, which was endowed with
the power of speaking and delivering oracles. The outward
course of the &ldquo;Argo&rdquo; was the same as that of the Greek traders,
whose settlements as early as the 6th century <span class="scs">B.C.</span> dotted the
southern shores of the Euxine. The first landing-place was the
island of Lemnos, which was occupied only by women, who had
put to death their fathers, husbands and brothers. Here the
Argonauts remained some months, until they were persuaded
by Heracles to leave. It is known from Herodotus (iv. 145)
that the Minyae had formed settlements at Lemnos at a very
early date. Proceeding up the Hellespont, they sailed to the
country of the Doliones, by whose king, Cyzicus, they were
hospitably received. After their departure, being driven back
to the same place by a storm, they were attacked by the Doliones,
who did not recognize them, and in a battle which took place
Cyzicus was killed by Jason. After Cyzicus had been duly
mourned and buried, the Argonauts proceeded along the coast
of Mysia, where occurred the incident of Heracles and Hylas
(<i>q.v.</i>). On reaching the country of the Bebryces, they again
landed to get water, and were challenged by the king, Amycus,
to match him with a boxer. Polydeuces came forward, and in
the end overpowered his adversary, and bound him to a tree, or
according to others, slew him. At the entrance to the Euxine,
at Salmydessus on the coast of Thrace, they met Phineus, the
blind and aged king whose food was being constantly polluted
by the Harpies. He knew the course to Colchis, and offered
to tell it, if the Argonauts would free him from the Harpies.
This was done by the winged sons of Boreas, and Phineus now
told them their course, and that the way to pass through the
Symplegades or Cyanean rocks&mdash;two cliffs which moved on their
bases and crushed whatever sought to pass&mdash;was first to fly a
pigeon through, and when the cliffs, having closed on the pigeon,
began to retire to each side, to row the &ldquo;Argo&rdquo; swiftly through.
His advice was successfully followed, and the &ldquo;Argo&rdquo; made
the passage unscathed, except for trifling damage to the stern.
From that time the rocks became fixed and never closed again.
The next halting-places were the country of the Maryandini,
where the helmsman Tiphys died, and the land of the Amazons
on the banks of the Thermodon. At the island of Aretias they
drove away the Stymphalian birds, who used their feathers of
brass as arrows. Here they found and took on board the four
sons of Phrixus who, after their father&rsquo;s death, had been sent
by Aeetes, king of Colchis, to fetch the treasures of Orchomenus,
but had been driven by a storm upon the island. Passing near
Mount Caucasus, they heard the groans of Prometheus and the
flapping of the wings of the eagle which gnawed his liver. They
now reached their goal, the river Phasis, and the following
morning Jason repaired to the palace of Aeetes, and demanded
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page479" id="page479"></a>479</span>
the golden fleece. Aeetes required of Jason that he should first
yoke to a plough his bulls, given him by Hephaestus, which
snorted fire and had hoofs of brass, and with them plough the field
of Ares. That done, the field was to be sown with the dragons&rsquo;
teeth brought by Phrixus, from which armed men were to spring.
Successful so far by means of the mixture which Medea, daughter
of Aeetes, had given him as proof against fire and sword, Jason
was next allowed to approach the dragon which watched the
fleece; Medea soothed the monster with another mixture, and
Jason became master of the fleece. Then the voyage homeward
began, Medea accompanying Jason, and Aeetes pursuing them.
To delay him and obtain escape, Medea dismembered her young
brother Absyrtus, whom she had taken with her, and cast his
limbs about in the sea for his father to pick up. Her plan succeeded,
and while Aeetes was burying the remains of his son at
Tomi, Jason and Medea escaped. In another account Absyrtus
had grown to manhood then, and met his death in an encounter
with Jason, in pursuit of whom he had been sent. Of the homeward
course various accounts are given. In the oldest (Pindar)
the &ldquo;Argo&rdquo; sailed along the river Phasis into the eastern
Oceanus, round Asia to the south coast of Libya, thence to the
mythical lake Tritonis, after being carried twelve days over
land through Libya, and thence again to Iolcus. Hecataeus
of Miletus (Schol. Apollon. Rhod. iv. 259) suggested that from
the Oceanus it may have sailed into the Nile, and so to the
Mediterranean. Others, like Sophocles, described the return
voyage as differing from the outward course only in taking the
northern instead of the southern shore of the Euxine. Some
(pseudo-Orpheus) supposed that the Argonauts had sailed up
the river Tanaïs, passed into another river, and by it reached
the North Sea, returning to the Mediterranean by the Pillars of
Hercules. Again, others (Apollonius Rhodius) laid down the
course as up the Danube (Ister), from it into the Adriatic by a
supposed mouth of that river, and on to Corcyra, where a storm
overtook them. Next they sailed up the Eridanus into the
Rhodanus, passing through the country of the Celts and Ligurians
to the Stoechades, then to the island of Aethalia (Elba), finally
reaching the Tyrrhenian Sea and the island of Circe, who absolved
them from the murder of Absyrtus. Then they passed safely
through Scylla and Charybdis, past the Sirens, through the
Planctae, over the island of the Sun, Trinacria and on to Corcyra
again, the land of the Phaeacians, where Jason and Medea held
their nuptials. They had sighted the coast of Peloponnesus when
a storm overtook them and drove them to the coast of Libya,
where they were saved from a quicksand by the local nymphs.
The &ldquo;Argo&rdquo; was now carried twelve days and twelve nights to
the Hesperides, and thence to lake Tritonis (where the seer
Mopsus died), whence Triton conducted them to the
Mediterranean. At Crete the brazen Talos, who would not permit
them to land, was killed by the Dioscuri. At Anaphe, one of the
Sporades, they were saved from a storm by Apollo. Finally,
they reached Iolcus, and the &ldquo;Argo&rdquo; was placed in a groove
sacred to Poseidon on the isthmus of Corinth. Jason&rsquo;s death,
it is said, was afterwards caused by part of the stern giving
way and falling upon him.</p>

<p>The story of the expedition of the Argonauts is very old.
Homer was acquainted with it and speaks of the &ldquo;Argo&rdquo; as
well known to all men; the wanderings of Odysseus may have
been partly founded on its voyage. Pindar, in the fourth
Pythian ode. gives the oldest detailed account of it. In Greek,
there are also extant the <i>Argonautica</i> of Apollonius Rhodius
and the pseudo-Orpheus (4th century <span class="scs">A.D.</span>), and the account in
Apollodorus (i. 9), based on the best extant authorities; in Latin,
the imitation of Apollonius (a free translation or adaptation of
whose <i>Argonautica</i> was made by Terentius Varro Atacinus in the
time of Cicero) by Valerius Flaccus. In ancient times the expedition
was regarded as a historical fact, an incident in the opening
up of the Euxine to Greek commerce and colonization. Its
object was the acquisition of gold, which was caught by the
inhabitants of Colchis in fleeces as it was washed down the rivers.
Suidas says that the fleece was a book written on parchment, which
taught how to make gold by chemical processes. The rationalists
explained the ram on which Phrixus crossed the sea as the name
or ornament of the ship on which he escaped. Several interpretations
of the legend have been put forward by modern scholars.
According to C.O. Müller, it had its origin in the worship of
Zeus Laphystius; the fleece is the pledge of reconciliation;
Jason is a propitiating god of health, Medea a goddess akin to
Hera; Aeetes is connected with the Colchian sun-worship.
Forchhammer saw in it an old nature symbolism; Jason, the
god of healing and fruitfulness, brought the fleece&mdash;the fertilizing
rain-cloud&mdash;to the western land that was parched by the heat
of the sun. Others treat it as a solar myth; the ram is the light
of the sun, the flight of Phrixus and the death of Helle signify
its setting, the recovery of the fleece its rising again.</p>

France, extending along the borders of Lorraine and Champagne,
and forming part of the departments of Ardennes, Meuse
and Marne. The Argonne stretches from S.S.E. to N.N.W., a
distance of 63 m. with an average breadth of 19 m., and an average
height of 1150 ft. It forms the connecting-link between the
plateaus of Haute Marne and the Ardennes, and is bounded E.
by the Meuse and W. by the Ante and the Aisne, which rises in
its southern plateau. The valleys of the Aire and other rivers
traverse it longitudinally, a fact to which its importance as a
bulwark of north-eastern France is largely due. Of the numerous
forests which clothe both slopes of the plateau, the chief is that
of Argonne, which extends for 25 m. between the Aire and the
Aisne.</p>

<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">ARGOS,<a name="ar53" id="ar53"></a></span> the name of several ancient Greek cities or districts,
but specially appropriated in historic times to the chief town in
eastern Peloponnese, whence the peninsula of Argolis derives
its name. The Argeia, or territory of Argos proper, consisted
of a shelving plain at the head of the Gulf of Argolis, enclosed
between the eastern wall of the Arcadian plateau and the central
highlands of Argolis. The waters of this valley (Inachus, Charadrus,
Erasinus), when properly regulated, favoured the growth
of excellent crops, and the capital standing only 3 m. from the
sea was well placed for Levantine trade. Hence Argos was
perhaps the earliest town of importance in Greece; the legends
indicate its high antiquity and its early intercourse with foreign
countries (Egypt, Lycia, &amp;c.). Though eclipsed in the Homeric
age, when it appears as the seat of Diomedes, by the later
foundation of Mycenae, it regained its predominance after the
invasion of the Dorians (<i>q.v.</i>), who seem to have occupied this
site in considerable force. In accordance with the tradition
which assigned the portion to the eldest-born of the Heracleid
conquerors, Argos was for some centuries the leading power in
Peloponnesus. There is good evidence that its sway extended
originally over the entire Argolis peninsula, the land east of
Parnon, Cythera, Aegina and Sicyon. Under King Pheidon
the Argive empire embraced all eastern Peloponnesus, and its
influence spread even to the western districts.</p>

<p>This supremacy was first challenged about the 8th century
by Sparta. Though organized on similar lines, with a citizen
population divided into three Dorian tribes (and one containing
other elements), with a class of Perioeci (neighbouring dependents)
and of serfs, the Argives had no more constant foe than
their Lacedaemonian kinsmen. In a protracted struggle for the
possession of the eastern seaboard of Laconia in spite of the
victory at Hysiae (apparently in 669), they were gradually
driven back, until by 550 they had lost the whole coast strip
of Cynuria. A later attempt to retrieve this loss resulted in
a crushing defeat near Tiryns at the hands of King Cleomenes I.
(probably in 495), which so weakened the Argives that they
had to open the franchise to their Perioeci. By this time they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page480" id="page480"></a>480</span>
had also lost control over the other cities of Argolis, which they
never succeeded in recovering. Partly in consequence of its
defeat, partly out of jealousy against Sparta, Argos took no part
in the war against Xerxes. Indeed on this, as on later occasions,
its relations with Persia seem to have been friendly. About 470
the conflict with Sparta was renewed in concert with the
Arcadians, but all that the Argives could achieve was to destroy
their revolted dependencies of Mycenae and Tiryns (468 or 464).
In 461 they contracted an alliance with Athens, thus renewing
a connexion established by Peisistratus (<i>q.v.</i>). In spite of this
league Argos made no headway against Sparta, and in 451 consented
to a truce. A more important result of Athenian
intervention was the substitution of the democratic government
for the oligarchy which had succeeded the early monarchy; at
any rate forty years later we find that Argos possessed complete
democratic institutions.</p>

<p>During the early Peloponnesian War Argos remained neutral;
after the break-up of the Spartan confederacy consequent upon
the peace of Nicias the alliance of this state, with its unimpaired
resources and flourishing commerce, was courted on all sides.
By throwing in her lot with the Peloponnesian democracies and
Athens, Argos seriously endangered Sparta&rsquo;s supremacy, but
the defeat of Mantineia (418) and a successful rising of the Argive
oligarchs spoilt this chance. The speedily restored democracy
put little heart into the conflict, and beyond sending mercenary
detachments, lent Athens no further help in the war (see
<span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Peloponnesian War</a></span>).</p>

<p>At the outset of the 4th century, Argos, with a population
and resources equalling those of Athens, took a prominent part
in the Corinthian League against Sparta. In 394 the Argives
helped to garrison Corinth, and the latter state seems for a while
to have been annexed by them. But the peace of Antalcidas
(<i>q.v.</i>) dissolved this connexion, and barred Argive pretensions
to control all Argolis. After the battle of Leuctra Argos
experienced a political crisis; the oligarchs attempted a
revolution, but were put down by their opponents with such
vindictiveness that 1200 of them are said to have been executed
(370). The democracy consistently supported the victorious
Thebans against Sparta, figuring with a large contingent on the
decisive field of Mantineia (362). When pressed in turn by their
old foes the Argives were among the first to call in Philip of
Macedon, who reinstated them in Cynuria after becoming
master of Greece. In the Lamian War Argos was induced to
side with the patriots against Macedonia; after its capture
by Cassander from Polyperchon (317) it fell in 303 into the hands
of Demetrius Poliorcetes. In 272 the Argives joined Sparta in
resisting the ambition of King Pyrrhus of Epirus, whose death
ensued in an unsuccessful night attack upon the city. They
passed instead into the power of Antigonus Gonatas of Macedonia,
who maintained his control by means of tyrants. After several
unavailing attempts Aratus (<i>q.v.</i>) contrived to win Argos for the
Achaean League (229), in which it remained save during a brief
occupation by the Spartans Cleomenes III. (<i>q.v.</i>) and Nabis
(224 and 196).</p>

<p>The Roman conquest of Achaea enhanced the prosperity of
Argos by removing the trade competition of Corinth. Under
the Empire, Argos was the headquarters of the Achaean synod,
and continued to be a resort of Roman merchants. Though
plundered by the Goths in <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 267 and 395 it retained some of
its commerce and culture in Byzantine days. The town was
captured by the Franks in 1210; after 1246 it was held in fief
by the rulers of Athens. In later centuries it became the scene
of frequent conflicts between the Venetians and the Turks, and
on two occasions (1397 and 1500) its population was massacred
by the latter. Repeopled with Albanian settlers, Argos was
chosen as seat of the Greek national assembly in the wars of
independence. Its citadel was courageously defended by the
patriots (1822); in 1825 the city was burnt to the ground by
Ibrahim Pasha. The present town of 10,000 inhabitants is
a purely agricultural settlement. The Argive plain, though not
yet sufficiently reclaimed, yields good crops of corn, rice and
tobacco.</p>

<p>In the early days of Greece the Argives enjoyed high repute
for their musical talent. Their school of bronze sculpture,
whose first famous exponent was Ageladas (Hagelaidas), the
reputed master of Pheidias, reached its climax towards the end
of the 5th century in the atelier of Polyclitus (<i>q.v.</i>) and his
pupils. To this period also belongs the new Heraeum (see
below), one of the most splendid temples of Greece.</p>

<p>Remains of the early city are still visible on the Larissa
acropolis, which towers 900 ft. high to the north-west of the
town. A few courses of the ancient ramparts appear under the
double enceinte of the surviving medieval fortress. An aqueduct
of Greek times is represented by some fragments on the
south-western edge. In the slope above the town was hewn a
theatre equalling that of Athens in size. The Aspis or smaller
citadel to the north-east has revealed traces of an early Mycenaean
settlement; the Deiras or ridge connecting the two heights
contains a prehistoric cemetery.</p>

<p><i>The Argive Heraeum</i>.&mdash;Since 1892 investigation has added
considerably to our knowledge concerning the Argive Heraeum
or Heraion, the temple of Hera, which stood, according to
Pausanias, &ldquo;on one of the lower slopes of Euboea.&rdquo; The term
Euboea did not designate the eminence upon which the Heraeum
is placed, or the mountain-top behind the Heraeum only, but,
as Pausanias distinctly indicates, the group of foothills of the
hilly district adjoining the mountain. When once we admit that
this designated not only the mountain, which is 1730 ft. high,
but also the hilly district adjoining it, the general scale of distance
for this site grows larger. The territory of the Heraeum was
divided into three parts, namely Euboea, Acraea and Prosymna.
Pausanias tells us that the Heraeum is 15 stadia from Mycenae.
Strabo, on the other hand, says that the Heraeum was 40 stadia
from Argos and 10 from Mycenae. Both authors underestimate
the distance from Mycenae, which is about 25 stadia, or a little
more than 3 m., while the distance from Argos is 45 stadia, or a
little more than 5 m. The distance from the Heraeum to the
ancient Midea is slightly greater than to Mycenae, while that
from the Heraeum to Tiryns is about 6 m. The Argive Heraeum
was the most important centre of Hera and Juno worship in the
ancient world; it always remained the chief sanctuary of the
Argive district, and was in all probability the earliest site of
civilized life in the country inhabited by the Argive people. In
fact, whereas the site of Hissarlik, the ancient Troy, is not in
Greece proper, but in Asia Minor, and can thus not furnish the
most direct evidence for the earliest Hellenic civilization as such;
and whereas Tiryns, Mycenae, and the city of Argos, each
represent only one definite period in the successive stages of
civilization, the Argive Heraeum, holding the central site of
early civilization in Greece proper, not only retained its importance
during the three periods marked by the supremacy of
Tiryns, Mycenae and the city of Argos, but in all probability
antedated them as a centre of civilized Argive life. These conditions
alone account for the extreme archaeological importance
of this ancient sanctuary.</p>

<p>According to tradition the Heraeum was founded by Phoroneus
at least thirteen generations before Agamemnon and the
Achaeans ruled. It is highly probable that before it became
important merely as a temple, it was the fortified centre uniting
the Argive people dwelling in the plain, the citadel which was
superseded in this function by Tiryns. There is ample evidence
to show that it was the chief sanctuary during the Tirynthian
period. When Mycenae was built under the Perseïds it was
still the chief sanctuary for that centre, which superseded Tiryns
in its dominance over the district, and which this temple clearly
antedated in construction. According to the <i>Dictys Cretensis</i>,
it was at this Heraeum that Agamemnon assembled the leaders
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page481" id="page481"></a>481</span>
before setting out for Troy. In the period of Dorian supremacy,
in spite of the new cults which were introduced by these people,
the Heraeum maintained its supreme importance: it was here
that the tablets recording the succession of priestesses were kept
which served as a chronological standard for the Argive people,
and even far beyond their borders; and it was here that
Pheidon deposited the <span class="grk" title="obeliskoi">&#8000;&#946;&#949;&#955;&#943;&#963;&#954;&#959;&#953;</span> when he introduced coinage
into Greece.</p>

<p>We learn from Strabo that the Heraeum was the joint
sanctuary for Mycenae and Argos. But in the 5th century the
city of Argos vanquished the Mycenaeans, and from that time
onwards the city of Argos becomes the political centre of the
district, while the Heraeum remains the religious centre. And
when in the year 423 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>, through the negligence of the priestess
Chryseis, the old temple was burnt down, the Argives erected a
splendid new temple, built by Eupolemos, in which was placed the
great gold and ivory statue of Hera, by the sculptor Polyclitus,
the contemporary and rival of Pheidias, which was one of the
most perfect works of sculpture in antiquity. Pausanias
describes the temple and its contents (ii. 17), and in his time
he still saw the ruins of the older burnt temple above the
temple of Eupolemos.</p>

<p class="pt2">All these facts have been verified and illustrated by the
excavations of the American Archaeological Institute and School
of Athens, which were carried on from 1892 to 1895. In 1854
A.R. Rhangabé made tentative excavations on this site, digging
a trench along the north and east sides of the second temple.
Of these excavations no trace was to be seen when those of
1892 were begun. The excavations have shown that the
sanctuary, instead of consisting of but one temple with the ruins
of the older one above it, contained at least eleven separate
buildings, occupying an area of about 975 ft. by 325.</p>

<p>On the uppermost terrace, defined by the great Cyclopean
supporting wall, exactly as described by Pausanias, the
excavations revealed a layer of ashes and charred wood, below which
were found numerous objects of earliest date, together with
some remains of the walls resting on a polygonal platform&mdash;all
forming part of the earliest temple. Immediately adjoining
the Cyclopean wall and below it were found traces of small
houses of the rudest, earliest masonry which are pre-Mycenaean,
if not pre-Cyclopean.</p>

<p>We then descend to the second terrace, in the centre of which
the substructure of the great second temple was revealed,
together with so much of the walls, as well as the several
architectural members forming the superstructure, that it has been
possible for E.L. Tilton to design a complete restoration of the
temple. On the northern side of this terrace, between the second
temple and the Cyclopean supporting wall, a long stoa or colonnade
runs from east to west abutting at the west end in structures
which evidently contained a well-house and waterworks; while
at the eastern end of this stoa a number of chambers were erected
against the hill, in front of which were placed statues and
inscriptions, the bases for which are still extant. At the
eastern-most end of this second terrace a large hall with three rows
of columns in the interior, with a porch and entrance at the west
end facing the temple, is built upon elaborate supporting walls
of good masonry.</p>

<p>Below the second terrace at the south-west end a large and
complicated building, with an open courtyard surrounded on three
sides by a colonnade and with chambers opening out towards the
north, may have served as a gymnasium or a sanatorium. It is
of good early Greek architecture, earlier than the second temple.
A curious, ruder building to the north of this and to the west of
the second terrace is probably of much earlier date, perhaps of
the Mycenaean period, and may have served as propylaea.</p>

<p>Immediately below the second temple at the foot of the elevation
on which this temple stands, towards the south, and thus
facing the city of Argos, a splendid stoa or colonnade, to which
large flights of steps lead, was erected about the time of the
building of the second temple. It is a part of the great plan to
give worthy access to the temple from the city of Argos. To the
east of this large flights of steps lead up to the temple proper.</p>

<p>At the western extremity of the whole site, immediately beside
the river-bed, we again have a huge stoa running round two sides
of a square, which was no doubt connected with the functions of
this sanctuary as a health resort, especially for women, the goddess
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page482" id="page482"></a>482</span>
Hera presiding over and protecting married life and child-birth.
Finally, immediately to the north of this western stoa there is
an extensive house of Roman times also connected with baths.</p>

<p>While the buildings give archaeological evidence for every
period of Greek life and history from the pre-Mycenaean period
down to Roman times, the topography itself shows that the
Heraeum must have been constructed before Mycenae and
without any regard to it. The foothills which it occupies form
the western boundary to the Argive plain as it stretches down
towards the sea in the Gulf of Nauplia. While it was thus
probably chosen as the earliest site for a citadel facing the sea,
its second period points towards Tiryns and Midea. It could not
have been built as the sanctuary of Mycenae, which was placed
farther up towards the north-west in the hills, and could not
be seen from the Heraeum, its inhabitants again not being able
to see their sanctuary. The west building, the traces of bridges
and roads, show that at one time it did hold some relation to
Mycenae; but this was long after its foundation or the building
of the huge Cyclopean supporting wall which is coeval with the
walls of Tiryns, these again being earlier than those of Mycenae.
There are, moreover, traces of still more primitive walls, built
of rude small stones placed one upon the other without mortar,
which are in character earlier than those of Tiryns, and have
their parallel in the lowest layers of Hissarlik.</p>

<p>Bearing out the evidence of tradition as well as architecture,
the numerous finds of individual objects in terra-cotta figurines,
vases, bronzes, engraved stones, &amp;c., point to organized civilized
life on this site many generations before Mycenae was built,
<i>a fortiori</i> before the life as depicted by Homer flourished&mdash;nay,
before, as tradition has it, under Proetus the walls of Tiryns
were erected. We are aided in forming some estimate of the
chronological sequence preceding the Mycenaean age, as suggested
by the finds of the Heraeum, in the new distribution which
Dörpfeld has been led to make of the chronological stratification
of Hissarlik. For the layer, which he now assigns to the
Mycenaean period, is the sixth stratum from below. Now, as some
of the remains at the Heraeum correspond to the two lowest layers
of Hissarlik, the evidence of the Argive temple leads us far beyond
the date assigned to the Mycenaean age, and at least into the
second millennium <span class="scs">B.C.</span> (see also <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Aegean Civilization</a></span>). As to
its chronological relation to the Cretan sites&mdash;Cnossus, Phaestus,
&amp;c., and the &ldquo;Minoan&rdquo; civilization as determined by Dr A. Evans,
see the discussion under <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Crete</a></span>.</p>

<p>This sanctuary still holds a position of central importance as
illustrating the art of the highest period in Greek history, namely,
the art of the 5th century <span class="scs">B.C.</span> under the great sculptor
Polyclitus. Though the excavations in the second temple have
clearly revealed the outlines of the base upon which the great
gold and ivory statue of Hera stood, it is needless to say that
no trace of the statue itself has been found. From Pausanias
we learn that &ldquo;the image of Hera is seated and is of colossal
size: it is made of gold and ivory, and is the work of Polyclitus.&rdquo;
Based on the computations made by the architect of the
American excavations, E.L. Tilton, on the ground of the height
of the nave, the total height of the image, including the base
and the top of the throne, would be about 26 ft., the seated figure
of the goddess herself about 18 ft. It is probable that the face,
neck, arms and feet were of ivory, while the rest of the figure
was draped in gold. Like the Olympian Zeus of Pheidias, Hera
was seated on an elaborately decorated throne, holding in her
left hand the sceptre, surmounted in her case by the cuckoo
(as that of Zeus had an eagle), and in her right, instead of an
elaborate figure of Victory (such as the Athena Parthenos and
the Olympian Zeus held), simply a pomegranate. The crown
was adorned with figures of Graces and the Seasons. A Roman
imperial coin of Antoninus Pius shows us on a reduced scale the
general composition of the figure; while contemporary Argive
coins of the 5th century give a fairly adequate rendering of the
head. A further attempt has been made to identify the head
in a beautiful marble bust in the British Museum hitherto
known as Bacchus (Waldstein, <i>Journal of Hellenic Studies</i>,
vol. xxi., 1901, pp. 30 seq.)</p>

<p>We also learn from Pausanias that the temple was decorated
with &ldquo;sculptures over the columns, representing some the birth
of Zeus and the battle of the gods and giants, others the Trojan
War and the taking of Ilium.&rdquo; It was formerly supposed that
the phrase &ldquo;over the columns&rdquo; pointed to the existence of
sculptured metopes, but no pedimental groups. Finds made in the
excavations, however, have shown that the temple also had
pedimental groups. Besides numerous fragments of nude and draped
figures belonging to pedimental statues, a well-preserved and
very beautiful head of a female divinity, probably Hera, as well
as a draped female torso of excellent workmanship, both
belonging to the pediments, have been discovered. Of the metopes
also a great number of fragments have been found, together
with two almost complete metopes, the one containing the torso
of a nude warrior in perfect preservation, as well as ten
well-preserved heads. These statues bear the same relation to the
sculptor Polyclitus which the Parthenon marbles hold to
Pheidias; and the excavations have thus yielded most important
material for the illustration of the Argive art of Polyclitus in
the 5th century <span class="scs">B.C.</span></p>

<p><span class="bold">ARGYLL, EARLS AND DUKES OF<a name="ar59" id="ar59"></a></span>. The rise of this family
of Scottish peers, originally the Campbells of Lochow, and first
ennobled as Barons Campbell, is referred to in the article <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Argyllshire</a></span>.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Archibald Campbell,</span> 5th earl of Argyll (1530-1573), was
the elder son of Archibald, 4th earl of Argyll (d. 1558), and a
grandson of Colin, the 3rd earl (d. 1530). His great-grandfather
was the 2nd earl, Archibald, who was killed at Flodden in 1513,
and this nobleman&rsquo;s father was Colin, Lord Campbell (d. 1493),
the founder of the greatness of the Campbell family, who was
created earl of Argyll in 1457. With Lord James Stuart, afterwards
the regent Murray, the 5th earl of Argyll became an
adherent of John Knox about 1556, and like his father was one
of the most influential members of the party of religious reform,
signing what was probably the first &ldquo;godly band&rdquo; in December
1557. As one of the &ldquo;lords of the congregation&rdquo; he was one of
James Stuart&rsquo;s principal lieutenants during the warfare between
the reformers and the regent, Mary of Lorraine; and later with
Murray he advised and supported Mary queen of Scots, who
regarded him with great favour. It was about this time that
William Cecil, afterwards Lord Burghley, referred to Argyll as
&ldquo;a goodly gentleman universally honoured of all Scotland.&rdquo;
Owing to his friendship with Mary, Argyll was separated from
the party of Knox, but he forsook the queen when she
determined to marry Lord Darnley; he was, however, again on
Mary&rsquo;s side after Queen Elizabeth&rsquo;s refusal to aid Murray in 1565.
Argyll was probably an accomplice in the murder of Rizzio;
he was certainly a consenting party to that of Darnley, and then
separating himself from Murray he commanded Mary&rsquo;s soldiers
after her escape from Lochleven, and by his want of courage and
resolution was partly responsible for her defeat at Langside
in May 1568. Soon afterwards he made his peace with Murray,
but it is possible that he was accessory to the regent&rsquo;s murder
in 1570. After this event Argyll became lord high chancellor
of Scotland, and he died on the 12th of September 1573. His
first wife was an illegitimate daughter of James V., and he was
thus half-brother-in-law to Mary and to Murray. His relations
with her were not harmonious; he was accused of adultery,
and in 1568 he performed a public penance at Stirling.</p>

<p>He left no children, and on his death his half-brother Colin
(d. 1584) became 6th earl of Argyll. This nobleman, whose life
was partly spent in feuds with the regent Morton, died in October
1584. He was succeeded as 7th earl by his young son Archibald
(1576-1638), who became a Roman Catholic, fought for Philip III.
of Spain in Flanders, whither he had gone to avoid his creditors,
and, having entrusted the care of his estates to his son, died
in London.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Archibald Campbell</span>, 1st marquess and 8th earl of Argyll
(1607-1661), eldest son of Archibald, 7th earl, by his first wife,
Lady Anne Douglas, daughter of William, 1st earl of Morton, was
born in 1607<a name="fa1e" id="fa1e" href="#ft1e"><span class="sp">1</span></a> and educated at St Andrews University, where he
matriculated on the 15th of January 1622. He had early in
life, as Lord Lorne, been entrusted with the possession of the
Argyll estates when his father renounced Protestantism and took
service with Philip of Spain; and he exercised over his clan an
authority almost absolute, disposing of a force of 20,000 retainers,
and being, according to Baillie, &ldquo;by far the most powerful subject
in the kingdom.&rdquo; On the outbreak of the religious dispute
between the king and Scotland in 1637 his support was eagerly
desired by Charles I. He had been made a privy councillor in
1628, and in 1638 the king summoned him, together with Traquair
and Roxburgh, to London; but he refused to be won over,
openly and courageously warned Charles against his despotic
ecclesiastical policy, and showed great hostility towards Laud.
In consequence a secret commission was given to the earl of
Antrim to invade Argyllshire and stir up the Macdonalds against
the Campbells, a wild and foolish project which completely
miscarried. Argyll, who inherited the title by the death of his
father in 1638, had originally no preference for Presbyterianism,
but now definitely took the side of the Covenanters in defence of
the national religion and liberties. He continued to attend the
meetings of the Assembly after its dissolution by the marquess of
Hamilton, when Episcopacy was abolished. In 1639 he sent a
statement to Laud, and subsequently to the king, defending the
Assembly&rsquo;s action; and raising a body of troops he seized
Hamilton&rsquo;s castle of Brodick in Arran. After the pacification
of Berwick he carried a motion, in opposition to Montrose, by
which the estates secured to themselves the election of the lords
of the articles, who had formerly been nominated by the king, a
fundamental change in the Scottish constitution, whereby the
management of public affairs was entrusted to a representative
body and withdrawn from the control of the crown. An attempt
by the king to deprive him of his office as justiciary of Argyll and
Tarbet failed, and on the prorogation of the parliament by
Charles, in May 1640, Argyll moved that it should continue its
sittings and that the government and safety of the kingdom
should be secured by a committee of the estates, of which, though
not a member, he was himself the guiding spirit. In June he was
entrusted with a &ldquo;commission of fire and sword&rdquo; against the
royalists in Atholl and Angus, which, after succeeding in
entrapping the earl of Atholl, he carried out with completeness
and some cruelty. It was on this occasion that took place the burning
of &ldquo;the bonnie house of Airlie.&rdquo; By this time the personal
rivalry and difference in opinion between Montrose and Argyll
had led to an open breach. The former arranged that on the
occasion of Charles&rsquo;s approaching visit to Scotland, Argyll should
be accused of high treason in the parliament. The plot, however,
was disclosed, and Montrose with others was imprisoned.
Accordingly when the king arrived he found himself deprived of
every remnant of influence and authority. It only remained for
Charles to make a series of concessions. He transferred the
control over judicial and political appointments to the
parliament, created Argyll a marquess (1641) with a pension of £1000
a year, and returned home, having in Clarendon&rsquo;s words &ldquo;made a
perfect deed of gift of that kingdom.&rdquo; Meanwhile the king&rsquo;s
policy of peace and concession had, as usual, been rudely and
treacherously interrupted by a resort to force, an unsuccessful
attempt, known as the &ldquo;incident,&rdquo; being made to kidnap
Argyll, Hamilton and Lanark. Argyll was mainly instrumental
at this crisis in keeping the national party faithful to what was
to him evidently the common cause, and in accomplishing the
alliance with the Long Parliament in 1643. In January 1644 he
accompanied the Scottish army into England as a member of the
committee of both kingdoms and in command of a troop of horse,
but was soon in March compelled to return to suppress royalist
movements in the north and to defend his own territories. He
compelled Huntly to retreat in April, and in July advanced to
meet the Irish troops now landed in Argyllshire, which were
acting in conjunction with Montrose, who had put himself at the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page484" id="page484"></a>484</span>
head of the royalist forces in Scotland. A campaign followed in
the north in which neither general succeeded in obtaining any
advantage over the other, or even in engaging battle. Argyll
then returned to Edinburgh, threw up his commission, and
retired to Inveraray Castle. Thither Montrose unexpectedly
followed him in December, compelled him to flee to Roseneath,
and devastated his territories. On the 2nd of February 1645,
when following Montrose northwards, Argyll was surprised by
him at Inverlochy and witnessed from his barge on the lake, to
which he had retired owing to a dislocated arm, a fearful slaughter
of his troops, which included 1500 of the Campbells. He arrived
at Edinburgh on the 12th of February and was again present
at Montrose&rsquo;s further great victory on the 15th of August at
Kilsyth, whence he escaped to Newcastle. Argyll was at last
delivered from his formidable antagonist by Montrose&rsquo;s final
defeat at Philiphaugh on the 12th of September. In 1646 he was
sent to negotiate with the king at Newcastle after his surrender
to the Scottish army, when he endeavoured to moderate the
demands of the parliament and at the same time to persuaade the
king to accept them. On the 7th of July 1646 he was appointed
a member of the Assembly of Divines.</p>

<p>Up to this point the statesmanship of Argyll had been highly
successful. The national liberties and religion of Scotland had
been defended and guaranteed, and the power of the king in
Scotland reduced to a mere shadow. In addition, these privileges
had been still further secured by the alliance with
the English opposition, and by the subsequent triumph of the
parliament and Presbyterianism in the neighbouring kingdom.
The sovereign himself, after vainly contending in arms, was a
prisoner in their midst. But Argyll&rsquo;s influence could not survive
the rupture of the alliance between the two nations on which his
whole policy was constructed. He opposed in vain the secret
treaty now concluded between the king and the Scots against the
parliament, and while Hamilton marched into England and was
defeated by Cromwell at Preston, Argyll, after a narrow escape
from a surprise at Stirling, joined the Whiggamores, a body of
Covenanters at Edinburgh; and, supported by London, Leven
and Leslie, he established a new government, which welcomed
Cromwell on his arrival there on the 4th of October. This alliance,
however, was at once destroyed by the execution of Charles I.,
which excited universal horror in Scotland. In the series of
tangled incidents which followed, Argyll lost control of the
national policy. He describes himself at this period as &ldquo;a
distracted man ... in a distracted time&rdquo; whose &ldquo;remedies ... had
the quite contrary operation.&rdquo; He supported the
invitation from the Covenanters to Charles II. to land in Scotland,
gazed upon the captured Montrose, bound on a cart on his way to
execution at Edinburgh, and subsequently, when Charles II.
came to Scotland, having signed the Covenant and repudiated
Montrose, Argyll remained at the head of the administration.
After the defeat of Dunbar, Charles retained his support by the
promise of a dukedom and the Garter, and an attempt was made
by Argyll to marry the king to his daughter. On the 1st of
January 1651 he placed the crown on Charles&rsquo;s head at Scone.
But his power had now passed to the Hamilton party. He
strongly opposed, but was unable to prevent, the expedition into
England, and in the subsequent reduction of Scotland, after
having held out in Inveraray Castle for nearly a year, was at last
surprised in August 1652 and submitted to the Commonwealth.
His ruin was then complete. His policy had failed, his power had
vanished. In his estate he was hopelessly in debt, and on terms
of such violent hostility with his eldest son as to be obliged to
demand a garrison in his house for his protection. During his
visit to Monk at Dalkeith in 1654 to complain of this, he was
subjected to much personal insult from his creditors, and on
visiting London in September 1655 to obtain money due to him
from the Scottish parliament, he was arrested for debt, though
soon liberated. In Richard Cromwell&rsquo;s parliament of 1659
Argyll sat as member for Aberdeenshire. At the Restoration he
presented himself at Whitehall, but was at once arrested by order
of Charles and placed in the Tower (1660), being sent to Edinburgh
to stand his trial for high treason. He was acquitted of complicity
in the death of Charles I., and his escape from the whole
charge seemed imminent, but the arrival of a packet of letters
written by Argyll to Monk showed conclusively his collaboration
with Cromwell&rsquo;s government, particularly in the suppression
of Glencairn&rsquo;s royalist rising in 1652. He was immediately
sentenced to death, his execution by beheading taking place on
the 27th of May 1661, before even the death warrant had been
signed by the king. His head was placed on the same spike
upon the west end of the Tolbooth on which that of Montrose
had previously been exposed, and his body was buried at the
Holy Loch, where the head was also deposited in 1664. A
monument was erected to his memory in St Giles&rsquo;s church in
Edinburgh in 1895.</p>

<p>While imprisoned in the Tower he wrote <i>Instructions to a
Son</i> (1661; reprinted in 1689 and 1743). Some of his speeches,
including the one delivered on the scaffold, were published
and are printed in the <i>Harleian Miscellany</i>. He married Lady
Margaret Douglas, daughter of William, 2nd earl of Morton, and
had two sons and four daughters.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Archibald Campbell</span>, 9th earl of Argyll (1629-1685), eldest
son of the 8th earl, studied abroad, and at the age of thirteen
was appointed captain in the Scottish regiment serving in
France under his uncle the earl of Irvine. He returned home
at the close of 1649, and was made captain of Charles II.&rsquo;s life
guards on the king&rsquo;s arrival in Scotland in 1650. He declared
himself a royalist in opposition to his father, with the view, as
some said, of securing the family estates in any event. He
fought at Dunbar on the 3rd of September 1650, and after the
battle of Worcester joined Glencairn in the Highlands. Bitter
disputes arose, and on the 2nd of January 1654 Lorne, quitting
his troops, fled to avoid arrest. In 1653 he submitted to Monk.
He appears, however, to have maintained communications with
Charles, and on his refusal to take the oath renouncing allegiance
to the Stuarts in 1657 he was imprisoned, remaining in confinement
probably till a short time before the Restoration. He
was then well received at court by Charles II. After the execution
of his father, he endeavoured to obtain the restitution of his
forfeited estates and title, but having incautiously attacked
certain members of the government in letters which were made
public, he was indicted at Edinburgh on the capital charge of
&ldquo;leasing-making&rdquo; and was sentenced to death on the 26th of
August. He remained a prisoner in Edinburgh Castle till the
4th of June 1663, when the sentence was cancelled and he was
re-created earl and restored to his estates. He disapproved
of the severities practised upon the Covenanters in the west,
and in 1671 pleaded for milder methods. His staunch Protestantism
rendered him exceedingly obnoxious to James, duke of
York, who in 1680 arrived as high commissioner in Scotland
and at once expressed his jealousy of Argyll&rsquo;s immense territorial
influence. Argyll moved the re-enactment of &ldquo;all the acts
against popery&rdquo; omitted on James&rsquo;s account, and opposed the
exemption of the royal family from the test, though allowing
it in the case of James. In signing the test himself, in its final
form both ambiguous and self-contradictory, he made the
reservation &ldquo;so far as consistent with itself and the Protestant
faith,&rdquo; and declined to engage himself not to promote any alteration
of advantage in church or state. On his refusal to record
his oath in writing and to sign it, he was dismissed from the
Scottish privy council, and on the 9th of November 1681 was
accused of treason, a charge which Halifax declared openly in
England &ldquo;they would not hang a dog upon.&rdquo; A trial followed,
a scandalous exhibition of illegality and injustice, at the close
of which Argyll was sentenced to death and to the forfeiture of
his estates. Shortly afterwards, through the instrumentality
of his step-daughter, Sophia Lindsay, he succeeded in making
his escape, and after some adventures retired to Holland. His
subsequent movements are uncertain, but he appears to have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page485" id="page485"></a>485</span>
again visited London, and was in correspondence with the Rye
House plotters and proposing to head a rebellion in Scotland
in 1683. In 1685 he joined the conspiracy in Holland to set
Monmouth on the throne instead of James II., arriving in Orkney
on the 6th of May and making his way to his own country. But
his clansmen refused to join him, and whatever small chances of
success remained were destroyed by constant and paralysing
disputes. His ships and ammunition were captured, and after
some aimless wanderings he found himself deserted, with but
one companion, Major Fullerton. On the 18th of June he was
taken prisoner at Inchinnan and arrived at Edinburgh on the
20th, where he was paraded through the streets and put in
irons in the castle. James ordered his summary execution on
the 29th, and it was carried out by beheading on the following
day, on the old charge of 1681. His head was exposed on the
west side of the Tollbooth, where his father&rsquo;s and Montrose&rsquo;s
had also been exhibited, his body finding its final place of burial
at Inveraray.</p>

<p>By his first wife, Lady Mary Stewart, daughter of the 4th
earl of Moray (Murray), he had four sons and three daughters.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Archibald Campbell</span>, 1st duke of Argyll (? 1651-1703), was
the eldest son of the 9th earl. He tried to get his father&rsquo;s
attainder reversed by seeking the king&rsquo;s favour, but being unsuccessful he went over to the Hague and joined William of
Orange as an active promoter of the revolution of 1688. In
spite of the attainder, he was admitted in 1689 to the convention
of the Scottish estates as earl of Argyll, and he was deputed,
with Sir James Montgomery and Sir John Dalrymple, to present
the crown to William III. in its name, and to tender him the
coronation oath. In 1690 an act was passed restoring his title
and estates, and it was in connexion with the refusal of the
Macdonalds of Glencoe to join in the submission to him that
he organized the terrible massacre which has made his name
notorious. In 1696 he was made a lord of the treasury, and his
political services were rewarded in 1701 by his being created
duke of Argyll. He had two sons by his wife Elizabeth, daughter
of Sir Lionel Talmash, John (the 2nd duke) and Archibald (the
3rd duke.)</p>

<p><span class="sc">John Campbell</span>, 2nd duke of Argyll and duke of Greenwich
(1678-1743), was born on the 10th of October 1678. He entered
the army in 1694, and in 1701 was promoted to the command
of a regiment. On the death of his father in 1703, he was appointed
a member of the privy council, and at the same time
colonel of the Scotch horse guards, and one of the extraordinary
lords of session. In return for his services in promoting the
Union, he was created (1705) a peer of England, by the titles
of baron of Chatham and earl of Greenwich, and in 1710 was
made a knight of the Garter. He first distinguished himself
in a military capacity at the battle of Oudenarde (1708), where
he served as a brigadier-general; and was afterwards present
under the duke of Marlborough at the sieges of Lille, Ghent,
Bruges and Tournay, and did remarkable service at the battle
of Malplaquet in 1709. He was very popular with the troops,
and his rivalry with Marlborough on this account is thought to
have been the cause of the enmity shown by Argyll afterwards
to his old commander. In 1711 he was sent to take command
in Spain; but being seized with a violent fever at Barcelona, and
disappointed of supplies from home, he returned to England.
Having a seat in the House of Lords, and being gifted with an
extraordinary power of oratory, he censured the measures of the
ministry with such freedom that all his places were disposed of
to other noblemen; but at the accession of George I. he recovered
his influence. On the breaking out of the rebellion in 1715 he
was appointed commander-in-chief of the forces in North Britain,
and was principally instrumental in effecting the total extinction
of the rebellion in Scotland without much bloodshed. He
arrived in London early in March 1716, and at first stood high
in the favour of the king, but in a few months was strippee of
his offices. This disgrace, however, did not deter him from the
discharge of his parliamentary duties; he supported the bill
for the impeachment of Bishop Atterbury, and lent his aid to
his countrymen by opposing the bill for punishing the city of
Edinburgh for the Porteous riot. In the beginning of the year
1719 he was again admitted into favour, appointed lord steward
of the household, and, in April following, created duke of Greenwich;
he held various offices in succession, and in 1735 was
made a field marshall. He continued in the administration till
after the accession of George II., when, in April 1740, a violent
speech against the government led again to his dismissal from
office. He was soon restored on a change of the ministry, but
disapproving the measures of the new administration, and
apparently disappointed at not being given the command of the
army, he shortly resigned all his posts, and spent the rest of
his life in privacy and retirement. He died on the 4th of
October 1743. A monument by Roubillac was erected to his
memory in Westminster Abbey. He was twice married, and
by his second wife, Jane Warburton, had five daughters; his
Scottish titles passed to his brother, but his English titles became
extinct, and though his eldest daughter was created baroness of
Greenwich in 1767 this title also became extinct on her death
in 1794.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Archibald Campbell</span>, 3rd duke of Argyll (1682-1761), was
born at Ham House in Surrey, in June 1682. On his father
being created a duke, he joined the army, and served for a short
time under the duke of Marlborough. In 1705 he was appointed
treasurer of Scotland, and in the following year was one of the
commissioners for treating of the Union; on the consummation
of which, having been raised to the peerage of Scotland as earl
of Islay, he was chosen one of the sixteen peers for Scotland in
the first parliament of Great Britain. In 1711 he was called to
the privy council, and commanded the royal army at the battle
of Sheriffmuir in 1715. he was appointed keeper of the privy
seal in 1721, and was afterwards entrusted with the principal
management of Scottish affairs to an extent which caused him
to be called &ldquo;king of Scotland.&rdquo; In 1733 he was made keeper
of the great seal, an office which he held till his death. He
succeeded to the dukedom in 1743. Both as earl of Islay and as
duke of Argyll he was prominently connected (with Duncan
Forbes of Culloden) with the movement for consolidating
Scottish loyalty by the formation of locally recruited highland
regiments. The duke was eminent not only for his political
abilities, but also for his literary accomplishments, and he
collected one of the most valuable private libraries in Great
Britain. He died suddenly on the 15th of April 1761. He was
married but had no legitimate issue, and his English property
was left to a Mrs Williams, by whom he had a son, William
Campbell.</p>

<p>The succession now passed to the descendants of the younger
son of the 9th earl, the Campbells of Mamore; the 4th duke died
in 1770, and was succeeded by his son <span class="sc">John</span>, the 5th duke (1723-1806)
He was a soldier who had fought at Dettingen and
Culloden, and became colonel of the 42nd regiment (Black
Watch), and eventually a field marshall. He sat in the House
of Commons for Glasgow from 1744 to 1761, when on his father&rsquo;s
succession to the dukedom he became legally disqualified, as
courtesy marquess of Lorne, for a Scottish constituency; he could
sit, however, for an English one, and was returned for Dover,
which he represented till 1766, when he was created an English
peer as Baron Sundridge, the title by which till 1892 the dukes
of Argyll sat in the House of Lords. The 5th duke was an
active landlord, and was the first president of the Highland and
Agricultural Society. In 1759 he had married the widowed
duchess of Hamilton (the beautiful Elizabeth Gunning), by whom
he had two sons and two daughters. The eldest of his sons,
<span class="sc">George</span> (d. 1841), became 6th duke, and on his death was
succeeded as 7th duke by his brother <span class="sc">John</span> (1777-1847), who
from 1799-1822 sat in parliament as member for Argyllshire.
He was thrice married, and by his second wife, Joan Glassell
(d. 1828), had two sons, the eldest of whom (b. 1821) died
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page486" id="page486"></a>486</span>
in 1837, and two daughters, the second of whom died in
infancy.</p>

<p><span class="sc">George John Douglas Campbell</span>, 8th duke (1823-1900),
the second son of the 7th duke, was born on the 30th of April
1823, and succeeded his father in April 1847. He had already
obtained notice as a writer of pamphlets on the disruption of the
Church of Scotland, which he strove to avert, and he rapidly
became prominent on the Liberal side in parliamentary politics.
He was a frequent and eloquent speaker in the House of Lords,
and sat as lord privy seal (1852) and postmaster-general (1855)
in the cabinets of Lord Aberdeen and Lord Palmerston. In
Mr Gladstone&rsquo;s cabinet of 1868 he was secretary of state for
India, and somewhat infelicitously signalized his term of office
by his refusal, against the advice of the Indian government,
to promise the amir of Afghanistan support against Russian
aggression, a course which threw that ruler into the arms of
Russia and was followed by the second Afghan War. His
eminence alike as a great Scottish noble, and as a British statesman,
was accentuated in 1871 when his son, the marquess of
Lorne, married Princess Louise, the fourth daughter of Queen
Victoria; but in the political world few memorable acts on his
part call for record except his resignation of the office of lord
privy seal, which he held in Mr Gladstone&rsquo;s administration of
1880, from his inability to assent to the Irish land legislation
of 1881. He opposed the Home Rule Bill with equal vigour,
though Mr Gladstone subsequently stated that, among all the
old colleagues who dissented from his course, the duke was the
only one whose personal relations with him remained entirely
unchanged. Detached from party, the duke took an independent
position, and for many years spoke his mind with great freedom
in letters to <i>The Times</i> on public questions, especially such as
concerned the rights or interests of landowners. He was no less
active on scientific questions in their relation to religion, which
he earnestly strove to reconcile with the progress of discovery.
With this aim he published <i>The Reign of Law</i> (1866), <i>Primeval
Man</i> (1869), <i>The Unity of Nature</i> (1884), <i>The Unseen Foundations
of Society</i> (1893), and other essays. He also wrote on the
Eastern question, with especial reference to India, the history
and antiquities of Iona, patronage in the Church of Scotland, and
many other subjects. The duke (to whose Scottish title was added
a dukedom of the United Kingdom in 1892) died on the 24th of
April 1900. He was thrice married: first (1844) to a daughter
of the second duke of Sutherland (d. 1878); secondly (1881) to
a daughter of Bishop Claughton of St Albans (d. 1894); and
thirdly (1895) to Ina Erskine M&lsquo;Neill. Few men of the duke&rsquo;s
era displayed more versatility of intellect, and he was remarkable
among the men of his time for his lofty eloquence.</p>

<p>He was succeeded as 9th duke by his eldest son <span class="sc">John Douglas
Sutherland Campbell</span> (1845-&emsp;emsp;), whose marriage in 1871
to H.R.H. Princess Louise gave him a special prominence in
English public life. He was governor-general of Canada from
1878 to 1883; member of parliament for South Manchester, in
the Unionist interest, 1895 to 1900; and he also became known
as a writer both in prose and verse. In 1907 he published his
reminiscences, <i>Pages from the Past</i>.</p>

<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">ARGYLLSHIRE,<a name="ar60" id="ar60"></a></span> a county on the west coast of Scotland, the
second largest in the country, embracing a large tract of country
on the mainland and a number of the Hebrides or Western Isles.
The mainland portion is bounded N. by Inverness-shire; E. by
Perth and Dumbarton, Loch Long and the Firth of Clyde;
S. by the North Channel (Irish Sea); and W. by the Atlantic.
Its area is 1,990,471 acres or 3110 sq. m. The principal districts
are Ardnamurchan on the Atlantic, Ardnamurchan Point being
the most westerly headland of Scotland; Morven or Morvern,
bounded by Loch Sunart, the Sound of Mull and Loch Linnhe;
Appin, on Loch Linnhe, with piers at Ballachulish and Port
Appin; Benderloch, lying between Loch Creran and Loch Etive;
Lorne, surrounding Loch Etive and giving the title of marquess
to the Campbells; Argyll, in the middle of the shire, containing
Inveraray Castle and furnishing the titles of earl and duke to
the Campbells; Cowall, between Loch Fyne and the Firth of
Clyde, in which lie Dunoon and other favourite holiday resorts;
Knapdale between the Sound of Jura and Loch Fyne; and
Kintyre or Cantyre, a long narrow peninsula (which, at the
isthmus of Tarbert, is little more than 1 m. wide), the southernmost
point of which is known as the Mull, the nearest part of
Scotland to the coast of Ireland, only 13 m. distant.</p>

<p>There are no navigable rivers. The two principal mountain
streams are the Orchy and Awe. The Orchy flows from Loch
Tulla through Glen Orchy, and falls into the north-eastern end
of Loch Awe; and the Awe drains the loch at its north-western
extremity, discharging into Loch Etive. Among other streams
are the Add, Aray, Coe or Cona, Creran, Douglas, Eachaig, Etive,
Euchar, Feochan, Finart, Fyne, Kinglass, Nell, Ruel, Shiel,
Shira, Strae and Uisge-Dhu. The county is remarkable for the
numerous sea-lochs which deeply indent the coast, the principal
being Loch Long (with its branches Loch Goil and the Holy
Loch), Loch Striven (Rothesay&rsquo;s &ldquo;weather glass&rdquo;), Loch
Riddon, Loch Fyne (with Loch Gilp and Loch Gair), Lochs
Tarbert, Killisport, Swin, Crinan, Craignish, Melfort, Feochan,
Etive, Linnhe (with its branches Loch Creran, Loch Leven and
Loch Eil) and Sunart. There are also a large number of inland
lakes, the total area of which is about 25,000 acres. Of these the
principal are Lochs Awe, Avich, Eck, Lydoch and Shiel. The
principal islands are Mull, Islay, Jura, Colonsay, Lismore, Tyree,
Coll, Gigha, Luing and Kerrera. Besides these there are the two
small but interesting islands of Staffa and Iona. The mountains
are so many as to give the shire a markedly rugged character.
Some of them are among the loftiest in the kingdom, as Ben
Cruachan with its summit of twin pyramids (3689 ft.), Ben More,
in Mull (3172), Ben Ima (3318), Buachaille Etive (3345), Ben
Bui (3106), Ben Lui (or Loy), on the confines of the shires of
Perth and Argyll (3708), Ben Starav near the head of Loch Etive
(3541), and Ben Arthur, called from its shape &ldquo;The Cobbler&rdquo;
(2891), on the borders of Dumbartonshire. There are many
picturesque glens, of which the best-known are Glen Aray, Glen
Croe, Glen Etive, Glendaruel, Glen Lochy (&ldquo;the wearisome glen&rdquo;&mdash;some
10 m. of bare hills and boulders&mdash;between Tyndrum and
Dalmally), Glen Strae, Hell&rsquo;s Glen (off Lech Goil) and Glencoe, the
scene of the massacre in 1692. The waterfalls of Cruachan are
beautiful; and those of Connel, which are more in the nature of
rapids, caused by the rush of the ebbing tide over the rocky bar
at the narrowing mouth of Loch Etive, have been made celebrated
by Ossian, who called them &ldquo;the Falls of Lora.&rdquo; In
several of the glens, as Glen Aray, small falls may be seen,
enhanced in beauty when the rivers are in flood. Pre-eminently
Argyll is the shire of the sportsman. The lovely Western Isles
provide endless enjoyment for the yachtsman; the lochs and
rivers abound with salmon and trout; the deer forests and
grouse moors are second to none in Scotland.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p><i>Geology</i>.&mdash;The mainland portion of the county consists chiefly of
the metamorphic rocks of the Eastern Highlands, nearly all the subdivisions
of that series (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Scotland</a></span>: <i>Geology</i>) being represented.
They form parallel belts of varying width trending north-east and
south-west. The slates and phyllites referred to the lowest group
occur along the shore at Dunoon, and are followed by the Beinn
Bheula grits and albite schists, forming nearly all the highest ground
in Cowall between Loch Fyne and the Firth of Clyde and the greater
part of Kintyre. The green beds, Glensluan mica-schists and Loch
Tay limestones are developed in Glendaruel, and have been traced
north-east to Glen Fyne and at intervals south-west to Campbeltown.
The next prominent zone is that of the Ardrishaig phyllites, with
quartzites in the lower portion and soft phyllites in the upper part,
which cover a belt from 3 to 6 m. across, stretching from Glen Shira
by Inveraray and Ardrishaig to south Knapdale.</p>

<p>Next in order come the Easdale slates, phyllites with thin dark
limestone, the main limestone of Loch Awe and the pebbly quartzite
(Schiehallion), which are repeated by innumerable folds and spread
northwards to Loch Linnhe and westwards to Jura and Islay. The
slates of this horizon have been largely quarried at Easdale and
Ballachulish, and this main limestone is typically developed near
Loch Awe, near Kilmartin, on the islands of Lismore and Shuna,
and in Islay between Bridgend and Portaskaig. The quartzites of
this series form the highest hills in the south of Islay, occupy nearly
the whole of Jura, and are continued in the mainland, where, by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page487" id="page487"></a>487</span>
means of the rapid isoclinal folding, they form lenticular masses. In
Islay and at various localities on the mainland a conglomerate
occurs at or near the base of the quartzites, which contains fragments
of the underlying rocks and boulders of granite not now found
in place in that region.</p>

<p>On the mainland, on the north side of the compound synclinal
folding of Loch Awe, the Ardrishaig phyllites reappear at Craignish
near Kilmartin, and the quartzites of this group are supposed to
come to the surface again in Glencoe, not far from the outcrop of the
Schiehallion quartzite.</p>

<p>The metamorphic rocks are associated with bands of epidiorite
which have shared in the folding and metamorphism of the region.
These are largely developed near Loch Awe, in Knapdale, and on the
south-east coast of Islay. They have been usually regarded as
intrusive, but south of Tayvallich on the mainland, lavas and tuffs,
which have escaped deformation, occur in the Easdale slates and the
pebbly limestone.</p>

<p>The Lower Old Red Sandstone, chiefly composed of volcanic
rocks&mdash;lavas and tuffs&mdash;rests unconformably on the metamorphic
series. These rocks cover a wide area in Lorne between Loch
Melfort, Oban and the Pass of Brander, and they reappear in the
lofty mountains on both sides of Glencoe. Representatives of this
formation are found in Kintyre, south of Campbeltown, where the
sediments prevail. The intrusive igneous rocks belonging to this
period are widely distributed and form conspicuous features. The
plutonic masses are represented by the granite of Ben Cruachan, by
the diorite of Gleann Domhainn, and by the kentallenite (a basic
rock related to the monxonites), near Ballachulish. Throughout the
Lorne volcanic plateau there are numerous dykes of porphyrite
which likewise traverse the schists and part of the Ben Cruachan
granite. Sheets of quartz-porphyry, lamprophyre and diorite are
also represented, the first of these types being quarried at Crarae on
the north shore of Loch Fyne.</p>

<p>The Upper Old Red Sandstone forms isolated patches resting
unconformably on all older rocks, on the west coast of Kintyre,
and between Campbeltown and Southend. In the district of
Campbeltown these red sandstones and cornstones are followed by
the volcanic rocks of the Calciferous Sandstone series, which lie
to the south of the depression at Machrihanish, and are succeeded
by the lower limestones and coals of the Carboniferous Limestone
series.</p>

<p>On the north and south shores of the promontory of Ardnamurchan
there are small patches of Jurassic strata ranging from the Lower
Lias to the Oxford Clay, and in Morvern on the shores of Loch Aline
representatives of the Upper Greensand are covered by the basaltic
lavas of Tertiary age. The acid and basic plutonic rocks (gabbros
and granophyres) of Tertiary time occur in Ardnamurchan. A
striking geological feature of the county is the number of dolerite
and basalt dykes trending in a north-west direction, which are
referred to the same period of intrusion. There is, however, another
group of dolerite dykes running east and west near Dunoon and
elsewhere, which are cut by the former and are probably of older
date.</p>

<p>Lead veins occur at Strontian which have yielded a number of
minerals, including sphalerite, fluorite, strontianite, harmotone,
brewsterite and pilolite. Near Inveraray, nickeliferous ore has been
obtained at two localities.</p>
</div>

<p><i>Climate</i>.&mdash;The rainfall is very abundant. At Oban, the
average annual amount is 64.18 in.; in Glen Fyne, 104.11 in.;
at the bridge of Orchy, 113.62 in., and at Upper Glencoe 127.65.
The prevailing winds, as observed near Crinan, are south-west
and south-east, and next in frequency are the north-west and
north-east. The average yearly temperature is 48° F.</p>

<p><i>Agriculture</i>.&mdash;Argyllshire was formerly partly covered with
natural forests, remains of which, consisting chiefly of oak, ash,
pine and birch, are still visible in the mosses; but, owing to
the clearance of the ground for the introduction of sheep, and
to past neglect of planting, the county is now remarkable for
its lack of wood, except in the neighbourhood of Inveraray,
where there are extensive and flourishing plantations, and a few
other places. Replanting, however, has been carried on. Most
of the county is unfitted for agriculture; but many districts
afford fine pasturage for mountain sheep; and some of the
valleys, such as Glendaruel, are very fertile. The chief crop
is oats; there is a little barley, but no wheat. The shire is one
of those where the crofting system exists, but it is by no means
universal. It is predominant in Tyree and the western district
of the mainland, but elsewhere farms of moderate size are the
rule. The cattle, though small, are equal to any other breed
in the kingdom, and are marketed in large numbers in the south.
Dairy farming is carried on to some extent in the southern parts
of Kintyre, where there is a large proportion of arable land.
In the higher tracts sheep have taken the place of cattle with
excellent results. The black-faced is the species most generally
reared.</p>

<p><i>Industries</i>.&mdash;Whisky is manufactured at Campbeltown, in
Islay, at Oban, Ardrishaig and elsewhere. Gunpowder is made
at Kames (Kyles of Bute), Melfort and Furnace. Coarse woollens
are made for home use; but fishing is the most important
industry, Loch Fyne being famous for its herrings. The season
lasts from June to January, but white fishing is carried on at
one or other of the ports all the year round. Slate and granite
quarrying and some coal-mining are the only other industries
of any consequence.</p>

<p><i>Communications</i>.&mdash;Owing partly to the paucity of trading
industries and partly to the fact that, owing to its greatly
indented coast-line, no place in the shire is more than 12 m.
from the sea, the railway mileage in the county is very small.
The Tyndrum to Oban section of the Caledonian railway company&rsquo;s
system is within the county limits; a small portion of
the track of the North British railway company&rsquo;s line to Mallaig
skirts the extreme west of the shire, and the Caledonian line
from Oban to Ballachulish serves the northern coast districts of
the Argyllshire mainland. In connexion with this last route
mention should be made of the cantilever bridge crossing the
Falls of Lora with a span of 500 ft. at a height of 125 ft. above
the water-way. The chief means of communication is by
steamers, which maintain regular intercourse between Glasgow
and various parts of the coast. In order to avoid the circuitous
passage round the Mull of Kintyre the Crinan Canal, across the
isthmus from Ardrishaig to Loch Crinan, a distance of 9 m.,
was constructed in 1793-1801, at a cost of £142,000. It has
15 locks, an average depth of 10 ft., a surface width of 66 ft., and
bottom width of 30 ft., is navigable by vessels of 200 tons, and
runs through a district of remarkable beauty. Another canal
unites Campbeltown with Dalavaddy. In summer the mails
for the islands and the great bulk of the tourist traffic by the
MacBrayne fleet is conveyed through the Crinan Canal,
transhipment being effected at Ardrishaig and Crinan. Throughout
the year goods traffic between the Clyde and elsewhere and the
West Highland ports is conveyed by deep-sea steamers round
the Mull. Before the advent of railways the shire contained
many famous coaching routes, but now coaches only run during
the tourist season, either in connexion with train and steamer,
or in districts still not served by either.</p>

<p><i>Population and Government</i>.&mdash;Owing to emigration, chiefly
to Canada, the population has declined, almost without a
break, since 1831, when it was 100,973, to 74,085 in 1891 and
73,642 in 1901, in which year there were 24 persons to the
sq. m. In 1901 the number of Gaelic-speaking persons was
34,224, of whom 3313 spoke Gaelic only. The chief towns are
Campbeltown (population in 1901, 8286), Dunoon (6779) and
Oban (5427), with Ardrishaig (1285), Ballachulish (1143),
Lochgilphead (1313) and Tarbert (1697). The county returns
a member to parliament. Inveraray, Campbeltown and Oban
belong to the Ayr district group of parliamentary burghs.
Argyllshire is a sheriffdom, and there are resident
sheriffs-substitute at Inveraray, Campbeltown and Oban; courts are
held also at Tobermory, Lochgilphead, Bowmore in Islay,
and Dunoon. Both Presbyterian bodies are strongly represented;
there are Roman Catholic and (Anglican) Episcopal
bishops of Argyll and the Isles, and there is a Roman Catholic
pro-cathedral at Oban. Campbeltown, Dunoon and Oban have
secondary schools, Tarbert public school has a secondary department,
and several other schools earn grants for giving
higher education. Part of the &ldquo;residue&rdquo; grant is spent by the
county council on classes of navigation and other subjects in
various schools, short courses in agriculture for farmers, and
in providing bursaries.</p>

<p><i>History</i>.&mdash;The early history of Argyll (Airergaidheal) is very
obscure. At the close of the 5th century Fergus, son of Erc,
a descendant of Conor II., <i>airdrigh</i> or high king of Ireland, came
over with a band of Irish Scots and established himself in Argyll
and Kintyre. Nothing more is known till, in the days of Conall I.,
the descendant of Fergus in the fourth generation, St Columba
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page488" id="page488"></a>488</span>
appears. Conall died in 574, and Columba was mainly instrumental
in establishing his first cousin, Aidan, founder of the
Dalriad kingdom and ancestor of the royal house of Scotland,
in power. In the 8th century Argyll, with the Western Islands
and Man, fell under the power of the Norsemen until, in the
12th century, Somerled (or Somhairle), a descendant of Colla-Uais,
<i>airdrigh</i> of Ireland (327-331), succeeded in ousting them
and established his authority, not only as thane of Argyll, but
also in Kintyre and the Western Islands. Somerled died in
1164 and his descendants maintained themselves in Argyll
and the islands, between the conflicting claims of the kings
of Scotland, Norway and Man, until the end of the 15th
century.</p>

<p>Up to 1222 Argyll had formed an independent Celtic princedom;
but in that year it was reduced by Alexander II., the
Scottish king, to a sheriffdom, and was henceforth regarded
as an integral part of Scotland. Among the various clans
in Argyll, the Campbells of Loch Awe, a branch of the clan
McArthur, now began to come to the fore, though the mainland
was still chiefly in the possession of the MacDougals. The
position of the lords of the house of Somerled was now curious,
since they were feudatories of the king of Norway for the isles
and of the king of Scotland for Argyll. Their policy in the wars
between the two powers was a masterly neutrality. Thus,
during the expedition of Alexander II. to the Western Isles in
1249, Ewan (Eoghan), lord of Argyll, refused to fight against the
Norwegians; in 1263 the same Ewan refused to join Haakon
of Norway in attacking Alexander III. Forty years later the
clansmen of Argyll, mainly MacDougals, were warring on the
side of Edward of England against Robert Bruce, by whom they
were badly beaten on Loch Awe in 1309. The clansmen of the
house of Somerled in the isles, on the other hand, the MacDonalds,
remained loyal to Scotland in spite of the persuasions of John
of Argyll, appointed admiral of Edward II.&rsquo;s western fleet;
and, under their chief Angus Og, they contributed much to the
victory of Bannockburn. The alliance of John, earl of Ross and
lord of the Isles, with Edward IV. of England in 1461 led to
the breaking of the power of the house of Somerled, and in 1478
John was forced to resign Ross to the crown and, two years later,
his lordships of Knapdale and Kintyre as well. In Argyll itself
the Campbells had already made the first step to supremacy
through the marriage of Colin, grandson of Sir Duncan Campbell
of Lochow, first Lord Campbell, with Isabel Stewart, eldest
of the three co-heiresses of John, third lord of Lorne. He
acquired the greater part of the lands of the other sisters by
purchase, and the lordship of Lorne from Walter their uncle, the
heir in tail male, by an exchange for lands in Perthshire. In
1457 he was created, by James II., earl of Argyll. He died on
the 10th of May 1493. From him dates the greatness of the house
of the earls and dukes of Argyll (<i>q.v.</i>), whose history belongs to
that of Scotland. The house of Somerled survives in two main
branches&mdash;that of Macdonald of the Isles, Alexander Macdonald
(d. 1795) having been raised to the peerage in 1776, and that
of the Macdonnells, earls of Antrim in Ireland. The principal
clans in Argyll, besides those already mentioned, were the
Macleans, the Stewarts of Appin, the Macquarries and the
Macdonalds of Glencoe, and the Macfarlanes of Glencroe. The
Campbells are still very numerous in the county.</p>

<p>Argyllshire men have made few contributions to English
literature. For long the natives spoke Gaelic only and their
bards sang in Gaelic (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Celt</a></span>: <i>Literature:</i> Scottish). Near
Inistrynich on the north-eastern shore of Loch Awe stands the
monumental cairn erected in honour of Duncan Ban McIntyre
(1724-1812), the most popular of modern Gaelic bards. But
the romantic beauty of the country has made it a favourite
setting for the themes of many poets and story-tellers, from
&ldquo;Ossian&rdquo; and Sir Walter Scott to Robert Louis Stevenson,
while not a few men distinguished in affairs or in learning have
been natives of the county.</p>

<p>The antiquities comprise monoliths, circles of standing stones,
crannogs and cairns. In almost all the burying-grounds&mdash;as
at Campbeltown, Keil, Soroby, Kilchousland, Kilmun&mdash;there
are specimens of sculptured crosses and slabs. Besides the
famous ecclesiastical remains at Iona (<i>q.v.</i>), there are ruins
of a Cistercian priory in Oronsay, and of a church founded
in the 12th century by Somerled, thane of Argyll, at Saddell.
Among castles may be mentioned Dunstaffnage, Ardtornish,
Skipness, Kilchurn (beloved of painters), Ardchonnel, Dunolly,
Stalker, Dunderaw and Carrick.</p>

<p><span class="bold">ARGYRODITE,<a name="ar61" id="ar61"></a></span> a mineral which is of interest as being that
in which the element germanium was discovered by C. Winkler
in 1886. It is a silver sulpho-germanate, Ag<span class="su">8</span>GeS<span class="su">6</span>, and
crystallizes in the cubic system. The crystals have the form of the
octahedron or rhombic dodecahedron, and are frequently
twinned. The botryoidal crusts of small indistinct crystals
first found in a silver mine at Freiberg in Saxony were originally
thought to be monoclinic, but were afterwards proved to be
identical with the more distinctly developed crystals recently
found in Bolivia. The colour is iron-black with a purplish tinge,
and the lustre metallic. There is no cleavage; hardness 2½,
specific gravity 6.2. It is of interest to note that the Freiberg
mineral was long ago imperfectly described by A. Breithaupt
under the name <i>Plusinglanz</i>, and that the Bolivian crystals
were incorrectly described in 1849 as crystallized brongniardite.
The name argyrodite is from the Greek <span class="grk" title="argurodaes">&#7936;&#961;&#947;&#965;&#961;&#974;&#948;&#951;&#962;</span>, rich in

is finely situated 1060 ft. above sea-level, on the eastern slopes
of the Acroceraunian mountains, and near the left bank of the
river Dhrynos, a left-hand tributary of the Viossa. It is the
capital of a sanjak bearing the same name, and was formerly

Argyrokastro has been variously identified with the ancient

<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">ARIA<a name="ar64" id="ar64"></a></span> (Ital. for &ldquo;air&rdquo;), a musical term, equivalent to the
English &ldquo;air,&rdquo; signifying a melody apart from the harmony, but
especially a musical composition for a single voice or instrument,
with an accompaniment of other voices or instruments.</p>

<p>The aria originally developed from the expansion of a single
vocal melody, generally on the lines of what is known as binary
form (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Sonata</a></span> and <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Sonata Forms</a></span>). Accordingly, while the
germs of aria form may be traceable in the highest developments
of folk-song, the aria as a definite art-form could not exist before
the middle of the 17th century; because up to that time the
whole organization of music was based upon polyphonic principles
which left no room for the development of melody for melody&rsquo;s
sake. When at the beginning of the 17th century the Monodists
(see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Harmony</a></span> and <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Monteverde</a></span>) inaugurated a new era and
showed in their first experiments the enormous possibilities
latent in their new art of accompanying single voices by instruments,
it was natural that for many years the mere suggestiveness
and variety of their experiments should suffice to retain the
attention of contemporary listeners, without any real artistic
coherence in the works as wholes. But, even at the outset,
mere novelty of harmony, however poignant its emotional
expression, was felt by the profounder spirits of the new art
to be an untrustworthy guide to progress. And Monteverde&rsquo;s
famous lament of the deserted Ariadne is one of many early
examples that appeal to an elementary sense of form by making
the last phrase identical with the first. As instrumental music
grew, and the modern sense of key became strong and consistent,
composers felt themselves more and more able to appeal to that
sense of harmonically consistent melody which has asserted
itself in folk-music before the history of harmonic music may be
said to have begun. The technique of solo singers grew as
rapidly as that of solo players, and composers soon found their
chief musical interest in doing justice to both. In Sir Hubert
Parry&rsquo;s work, <i>The Music of the 17th Century (Oxford History
of Music</i>, vol. iii.), will be found numerous illustrations of the
early development of aria forms, from their first indications
in Monteverde&rsquo;s instinctive struggles after coherence, to their
complete maturity in the works of Alessandro Scarlatti.</p>

<p>By Scarlatti&rsquo;s time it was thoroughly established that the binary
form of melody was that which could best be expanded into a
form which should do justice both to singers and to the players
who accompanied them. Thus the aria became on a small scale
the prototype of the Concerto; and under that heading will
accordingly be found all that need be said as to the relation
between the instrumental <i>ritornello</i> and the material of the voice
part in an aria.</p>

<p>So far we have spoken only of the main body of the aria;
but the addition of a middle section with a <i>da Capo</i>, which
constitutes the universal 18th-century <i>da Capo</i> form of aria,
adds a very simple new principle to the essential scheme without
really modifying it. A typical aria of the Scarlatti or Handelian
type is a very large melody in binary form, delivered by the
voice, which expands it with florid perorations before each
cadence (and sometimes also with florid preludes); while relief
is given to the voice, further spaciousness to the form, and
justice done to the accompaniment, by the addition of an
instrumental ritornello containing the gist of the melody not only
at the beginning and end, but also in suitable shorter forms
at the principal intermediate cadences in foreign keys. A
smaller scheme of the same kind in a new group of related keys,
but generally without much new material, is then appended as
a middle section after which follows the main section <i>da Capo</i>.
The result is generally a piece of music of considerable length,
in a form which cannot fail to be effective and coherent; and
there is little cause for wonder in the extent to which it dominated
18th-century music. It was not, however, invariable. In the
<i>Cavatina</i> we find a form too small for the <i>da Capo</i>; and in
the oratorios of Handel and the choral works of Bach we find
a majority of arias in a larger form which evades the possibility
of exact repetition.</p>

<p>The aria forms are profoundly influenced by the difference
between the Sonata style and the style of Bach and Handel.
But the scale of the form is inevitably small, and in any opera
an aria is hardly possible except in a situation which is a tableau
rather than an action. Consequently there is no such difference
between the form of the classical operatic aria of Mozart and that
of the Handelian type as there is between sonata music and
suite music. The scale, however, has become too large for the
<i>da Capo</i>, which was in any case too rigid to survive in music
designed to intensify a dramatic situation instead of to distract
attention from it. The necessary change of style was so successfully
achieved that, until Wagner succeeded in devising music
that moved absolutely <i>pari passu</i> with his drama, the aria
remained as the central formal principle in dramatic music;
and few things in artistic evolution are more interesting than
the extent to which Mozart&rsquo;s predecessor, the great dramatic
reformer Gluck, profited by the essential resources of his pet
aversion, the aria style, when he had not only purged it of what
had become the stereotyped ideas of ritornellos and vocal
flourishes, but animated it by the new sense of dramatic climax
to which the sonata style appealed.</p>

<p>In modern opera the aria is almost always out of place, and
the forms in which definite melodies nowadays appear are rather
those of the song in its limited sense as that of a poem in formal
stanzas all set to the same music. In other words, a song in a
modern opera tends to be something which would be sung even
if the drama had to be performed as a play without music;
whereas a classical aria would in non-musical drama be a soliloquy.
This can be shown by works at such opposite poles of musical
and dramatic technique as Bizet&rsquo;s <i>Carmen</i> and the later works
of Wagner. In <i>Carmen</i> the librettist has so managed that, if
his work were performed as a play, almost the whole of it would
have to be sung; and the one exception of musical importance
is the developed soliloquy of Micaëla in the third act, which,
although treated in no old-fashioned or commonplace spirit by the
composer, is the one thing in the opera which sounds &ldquo;operatic.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In the later works of Wagner those passages in which we can
successfully detach complete melodies from their context have,
one and all, dramatically the aspect of songs and not of
soliloquies.  Siegmund sings the song of Spring to his sister-bride;
Mime teaches Siegfried lessons of gratitude in nursery rhymes;
and the whole story of the <i>Meistersinger</i> is a series of opportunities
for song-singing.</p>

<p>The distinctions and gradations between aria and song are
of great aesthetic importance, but their history would carry
us too far. The distinction is obviously of the same importance
as that between dramatic and lyric poetry. Beethoven&rsquo;s
<i>Adelaïde</i> is a famous example of what is called a song when it is
really entirely in aria style; while the operas of Mozart and
Weber naturally contain in appropriate situations many numbers
which really are songs. The composers themselves generally give
appropriate names. Thus Mozart, in <i>Figaro</i>, calls &ldquo;Non so
piu cosa son&rdquo; an aria, because of its free style, though Cherubino
actually sings it as a song he has just invented; while &ldquo;Voi
che sapete,&rdquo; being more purely lyric, is called <i>Canzona</i>.</p>

<p>The term <i>aria form</i> is applied, generally most inaccurately,
to all kinds of slow cantabile instrumental music of which the
general design can be traced to the operatic aria. Mozart, for
example, is very fond of slow movements in large binary form
without development, and this is constantly called aria-form,
though the term ought certainly to be restricted to such examples
as have some traits of the aria style, such as the first slow movement
in the great serenade in B flat. At all events, until writers
on music have agreed to give the term some more accurate use,
it is as well to avoid it and its cognate version, <i>Lied-form</i>,
altogether in speaking of instrumental music.</p>

<p>The <i>air</i> or <i>aria</i> in a suite is a short binary movement in a
flowing rhythm in common or duple time and by no means of
the broadly tunelike quality which its name would seem to
imply.</p>

abandoned, while asleep on the island of Naxos, by Theseus,
who had fallen a victim to the charms of Aegle (Plutarch,

to a &ldquo;bright&rdquo; season of nature. Ariadne is the personification
of spring. In keeping with this, her festivals at Naxos present
a double character; the one, full of mourning and sadness,
represents her death or abandonment by Theseus, the other,
full of joy and revelry, celebrates her awakening from sleep
and marriage with Dionysus. Thus nature sleeps and dies during
winter, to awake in springtime to a life of renewed luxuriance.
With this may be compared the festivals of Adonis and Osiris
and the myth of Persephone. Theseus himself was said to have
founded a festival at Athens in honour of Ariadne and Dionysus
after his return from Crete. The story of Dionysus and Ariadne
was a favourite subject for reliefs and wall-paintings. Most
commonly Ariadne is represented asleep on the shore at Naxos,
while Dionysus, attended by satyrs and bacchanals, gazes
admiringly upon her; sometimes they are seated side by side
under a spreading vine. The scene where she is holding the
clue to Theseus occurs on a very early vase in the British
Museum. There is a statue of the sleeping Ariadne in the Vatican
Museum.</p>

<p><span class="bold">ARIAS MONTANO, BENITO<a name="ar67" id="ar67"></a></span> (1527-1598), Spanish Orientalist
and editor of the Antwerp Polyglot, was born at Fregenal de la
Sierra, in Estremadura, in 1527. After studying at the universities
of Seville and Alcala, he took orders about the year
1559 and in 1562 he was appointed consulting theologian to the
council of Trent. He retired to Peña de Aracena in 1564, wrote
his commentary on the minor prophets (1571), and was sent to
Antwerp by Philip II. to edit the polyglot Bible projected by
Christopher Plantin. The work appeared in 8 volumes folio,
between 1568 and 1573. León de Castro, a professor at Salamanca,
thereon brought charges of heresy against Arias Montano,
who was finally acquitted after a visit to Rome in 1575-1576.
He was appointed royal chaplain, but withdrew to Peña de
Aracena from 1579 to 1583; he resigned the chaplaincy in 1584,
and went into complete seclusion at Santiago de la Espada in
Seville, where he died in 1598.</p>

Chilean-governed province of Tacna, situated in 18° 28&prime; 08&Prime; S.
lat. and 70° 20&prime; 46&Prime; W. long. It is the port for Tacna, the capital
of the province, 38 m. distant, with which it is connected by rail,
and is the outlet for a large and productive mining district.
Arica at one time had a population of 30,000 and enjoyed much
prosperity, but through civil war, earthquakes and conquest,
its population had dwindled to 2853 in 1895 and 2824 in 1902.
The great earthquake of 1868, followed by a tidal wave, nearly
destroyed the town and shipping. Arica was captured, looted
and burned by the Chileans in 1880, and in accordance with the
terms of the treaty of Ancon (1883) should have been returned to
Peru in 1894, but this was not done. Late in 1906 the town
again suffered severely from an earthquake.</p>

<p><span class="bold">ARICIA<a name="ar69" id="ar69"></a></span> (mod. <i>Ariccia</i>), an ancient city of Latium, on the Via
Appia, 16 m. S.E. of Rome. The old town, or at any rate its
acropolis, now occupied by the modern town, lay high (1350 ft.
above sea-level) above the circular Valle Aricciana, which is
probably an extinct volcanic crater; some remains of its fortifications,
consisting of a mound of earth supported on each side by a
wall of rectangular blocks of peperino stone, have been discovered
(D. Marchetti, in <i>Notizie degli scavi</i>, 1892, 52). The lower town
was situated on the north edge of the valley, close to the Via
Appia, which descended into the valley from the modern Albano,
and re-ascended partly upon very fine substructions of <i>opus
quadratum</i>, some 200 yds. in length, to the modern Genzano.
Remains of the walls of the lower town, of the <i>cella</i> of a temple
built of blocks of peperino, and also of later buildings in brickwork
and <i>opus reticulatum</i>, connected with the post-station
(Aricia being the first important station out of Rome, cf. Horace,
<i>Sat.</i> i. 5. 1, <i>Egressum magna me excepit Aricia Roma hospitio
modico</i>) on the highroad, may still be seen (cf. T. Ashby in
<i>Mélanges de l&rsquo;école française de Rome</i>, 1903, 399). Aricia was
one of the oldest cities of Latium, and appears as a serious
opponent of Rome at the end of the period of the kings and
beginning of the republic. In 338 <span class="scs">B.C.</span> it was conquered by
C. Maenius and became a <i>civitas sine suffragio</i>, but was soon given
full rights. Even in the imperial period its chief magistrate was
styled <i>dictator</i>, and its council <i>senatus</i>, and it preserved its own
calendar of festivals. Its vegetables and wine were famous, and
the district is still fertile.</p>

<p><span class="bold">ARICINI<a name="ar70" id="ar70"></a></span>, the ancient inhabitants of Aricia (<i>q.v.</i>), the form of
the name ranking them with the Sidicini, Marrucini (<i>q.v.</i>), &amp;c.,
as one of the communities belonging probably to the earlier or
Volscian stratum of population on the west side of Italy, who
were absorbed by the Sabine or Latin immigrants. Special
interest attaches to this trace of their earlier origin, because of
the famous cult of Diana Nemorensis, whose temple in the forest
close by Aricia, beside the <i>lacus Nemorensis</i>, was served by &ldquo;the
priest who slew the slayer, and shall himself be slain&rdquo;; that is to
say, the priest, who was called <i>rex Nemorensis</i>, held office only so
long as he could defend himself from any stronger rival. This
cult, which is unique in Italy, is picturesquely described in the
opening chapter of J.G. Frazer&rsquo;s <i>Golden Bough</i> (2nd ed., 1900)
where full references will be found. Of these references the most
important are, perhaps, Strabo v. 3. 12; Ovid, <i>Fasti</i>, iii. 263-272;
and Suetonius, <i>Calig</i>. 35, whose wording indicates that the old-world
custom was dying out in the 1st century <span class="scs">A.D.</span> It is a
reasonable conjecture that this extraordinary relic of barbarism

<p><span class="bold">ARIÈGE<a name="ar71" id="ar71"></a></span>, an inland department of southern France, bounded
S. by Spain, W. and N. by the department of Haute-Garonne,
N.E. and E. by Aude, and S.E. by Pyrénées-Orientales. It
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page491" id="page491"></a>491</span>
embraces the old countship of Foix, and a portion of Languedoc
and Gascony. Area, 1893 sq. m. Pop. (1906) 205,684.
Ariège is for the most part mountainous. Its southern border is
occupied by the snow-clad peaks of the eastern Pyrenees, the
highest of which within the department is the Pic de Montcalm
(10,512 ft.). Communication with Spain is afforded by a large
number of <i>ports</i> or <i>cols</i>, which are, however, for the most part
difficult paths, and only practicable for a few months in the year.
Farther to the north two lesser ranges running parallel to the
main chain traverse the centre of the department from south-east
to north-west. The more southerly, the Montagne de Tabe,
contains, at its south-eastern end, several heights between 7200
and 9200 ft., while the Montagues de Plantaurel to the north of
Foix are of lesser altitude. These latter divide the fertile
alluvial plains of the north from the mountains of the centre
and south. The department is intersected by torrents belonging
to the Garonne basin&mdash;the Salat, the Arize, which, near Mas
d&rsquo;Azil, flows through a subterranean gallery, the Ariège and the
Hers. The climate is mild in the south, but naturally very
severe among the mountains. Generally speaking, the arable
land, which is chiefly occupied by small holdings, is confined to
the lowlands. Wheat, maize and potatoes are the chief crops.
Good vineyards and market gardens are found in the neighbourhood
of Pamiers in the north. Flax and hemp are also cultivated.
The mountains afford excellent pasture, and a considerable
number of cattle, sheep and swine are reared. Poultry- and bee-farming
flourish. Forests cover more than one-third of the
department and harbour wild boars and even bears. Game,
birds of prey and fish are plentiful. There is abundance of
minerals, including lead, copper, manganese and especially iron.
Grindstones, building-stone, talc, gypsum, marble and phosphates
are also produced. Warm mineral springs of note are found at
Ax, Aulus and Ussat. Pamiers and St Girons are the most important
industrial towns. Iron founding and forging, which have
their chief centre at Pamiers are principal industries. Flour-milling,
paper-making and cloth-weaving may also be mentioned.
Ariège is served by the Southern railway. It forms the diocese
of Pamiers and belongs to the ecclesiastical province of Toulouse.
It is within the circumscriptions of the académie (educational
division) and of the court of appeal of Toulouse and of the XVII.
army corps. Its capital is Foix; it comprises the arrondissements
of Foix, St Girons and Pamiers, with 20 cantons and
338 communes. Foix, Pamiers, St Girons and St Lizier-de-Cousérans
are the more noteworthy towns. Mention may also be made
of Mirepoix, once the seat of a bishopric, and possessing a cathedral
(15th and 16th centuries) with a remarkable Gothic spire.</p>

The name is probably to be associated with the fact that when
the sun is in this part of the heavens (in spring) sheep bring forth
their young; this finds a parallel in <i>Aquarius</i>, when there is
much rain. It is also a constellation, mentioned by Eudoxus
(4th century <span class="scs">B.C.</span>) and Aratus (3rd century <span class="scs">B.C.</span>); Ptolemy
catalogued eighteen stars, Tycho Brahe twenty-one, and
Hevelius twenty-seven. According to a Greek myth, Nephele,
mother of Phrixus and Helle, gave her son a ram with a golden
fleece. To avoid the evil designs of Hera, their stepmother,
Phrixus and Helle fled on the back of the ram, and reaching the
sea, attempted to cross. Helle fell from the ram and was drowned
(hence the <i>Hellespont</i>); Phrixus, having arrived in Colchis and
been kindly received by the king, Aeetes, sacrificed the ram to
Zeus, to whom he also dedicated the fleece, which was afterwards
carried away by Jason. Zeus placed the ram in the heavens as
the constellation.</p>

steal gold from the griffins that guarded it. In art they are
usually represented as richly dressed Asiatics, picturesquely
grouped with their griffin foes; the subject is often described

<p><span class="bold">ARIMINUM<a name="ar75" id="ar75"></a></span> (mod. <i>Rimini</i>), a city of Aemilia, on the N.E.
coast of Italy, 69 m. S.E. of Bononia. It was founded by the
Umbrians, but in 268 <span class="scs">B.C.</span> became a Roman colony with Latin
rights. It was reached from Rome by the Via Flaminia, constructed
in 220 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>, and from that time onwards was the bulwark
of the Roman power in Cisalpine Gaul, to which province it even
gave its name. Its harbour was of some importance, but is
now silted up, the sea having receded. The remains of its moles
were destroyed in 1807-1809. Ariminum became a place of
considerable traffic owing to the construction of the Via Aemilia
(187 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>) and the Via Popilia (132 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>), and is frequently mentioned
by ancient authors. In 90 <span class="scs">B.C.</span> it acquired Roman citizenship,
but in 82 <span class="scs">B.C.</span> having been held by the partisans of Marius,
it was plundered by those of Sulla (who probably made the
Rubicon the frontier of Italy instead of the Aesis), and a military
colony settled there. Caesar occupied it in 49 <span class="scs">B.C.</span> after
his crossing of the Rubicon. It was one of the eighteen richest
cities of Italy which the triumviri selected as a reward for their
troops. In 27 <span class="scs">B.C.</span> Augustus planted new colonists there, and
divided the city into seven <i>vici</i> after the model of Rome, from
which the names of the <i>vici</i> were borrowed. He also restored
the Via Flaminia (<i>Mon. Ancyr.</i> c. 20) from Rome to Ariminum.
At the entrance to the latter the senate erected, in his honour,
a triumphal arch which is still extant&mdash;a fine simple monument
with a single opening. At the other end of the <i>decumanus
maximus</i> or main street (3000 Roman ft. in length) is a fine
bridge over the Ariminus (mod. Marecchia) begun by Augustus
and completed by Tiberius in <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 20. It has five wide arches,
the central one having a span of 35 ft., and is well preserved.
Both it and the arch are built of Istrian stone. The present
Piazza Giulio Cesare marks the site of the ancient forum. The
remains of the amphitheatre are scanty; many of its stones
have gone to build the city wall, which must, therefore, at
the earliest belong to the end of the classical period. In
<span class="scs">A.D.</span> 1 Augustus&rsquo;s grandson Gaius Caesar had all the streets of
Ariminum paved. In <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 69 the town was attacked by the
partisans of Vespasian, and was frequently besieged in the Gothic
wars. It was one of the five seaports which remained Byzantine
until the time of Pippin. (See <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Rimini</a></span>.)</p>

<p><span class="bold">ARIOBARZANES,<a name="ar76" id="ar76"></a></span> the name of three ancient kings or satraps
of Pontus, and of three kings of Cappadocia and a Persian
satrap.</p>

<p>Of the Pontic rulers two are most famous, (1) The son of
Mithradates I., who revolted against Artaxerxes in 362 <span class="scs">B.C.</span> and
may be regarded as the founder of the kingdom of Pontus (<i>q.v.</i>).
According to Demosthenes he and his three sons received from
the Athenians the honour of citizenship. (2) The son of Mithradates
III., who reigned c. 266-240 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>, and was one of those
who enlisted the help of the invading Gauls (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Galatia</a></span>).</p>

<p>Of the Cappadocian rulers the best-known one (&ldquo;Philo-Romaeus&rdquo;
on the coins) reigned nominally from 93 to 63 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>,
but was three times expelled by Mithradates the Great and as
often reinstated by Roman generals. Soon after the third
occasion he formally abdicated in favour of his son Ariobarzanes
&ldquo;Philopator,&rdquo; of whom we gather only that he was murdered
some time before 51. His son Ariobarzanes, called &ldquo;Eusebes&rdquo;
and &ldquo;Philo-Romaeus,&rdquo; earned the gratitude of Cicero during
his proconsulate in Cilicia, and fought for Pompey in the civil
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page492" id="page492"></a>492</span>
wars, but was afterwards received with honour by Julius Caesar,
who subsequently reinstated him when expelled by Pharnaces
of Pontus. In 42 <span class="scs">B.C.</span> Brutus and Cassius declared him a traitor,
invaded his territory and put him to death.</p>

<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">ARION,<a name="ar77" id="ar77"></a></span> of Methymna, in Lesbos, a semi-legendary poet and
musician, friend of Periander, tyrant of Corinth. He flourished
about 625 <span class="scs">B.C.</span> Several of the ancients ascribe to him the invention
of the dithyramb and of dithyrambic poetry; it is
probable, however, that his real service was confined to the
organization of that verse, and the conversion of it from a mere
drunken song, used in the Dionysiac revels, to a measured
antistrophic hymn, sung by a trained body of performers. The
name Cycleus given to his father indicates the connexion of the
son with the &ldquo;cyclic&rdquo; or circular chorus which was the origin
of tragedy. According to Suidas he composed a number of songs
and proems; none of these is extant; the fragment of a hymn
to Poseidon attributed to him (Aelian, <i>Hist. An.</i> xii. 45) is spurious
and was probably written in Attica in the time of Euripides.
Nothing is known of the life of Arion, with the exception of
the beautiful story first told by Herodotus (i. 23) and elaborated
and embellished by subsequent writers. According to Herodotus,
Arion being desirous of exhibiting his skill in foreign countries
left Corinth, and travelled through Sicily and parts of Italy,
where he gained great fame and amassed a large sum of money.
At Taras (Tarentum) he embarked for his homeward voyage in a
Corinthian vessel. The sight of his treasure roused the cupidity
of the sailors, who resolved to possess themselves of it by putting
him to death. In answer to his entreaties that they would spare
his life, they insisted that he should either die by his own hand
on shipboard or cast himself into the sea. Arion chose the latter,
and as a last favour begged permission to sing a parting song.
The sailors, desirous of hearing so famous a musician, consented,
and the poet, standing on the deck of the ship, in full minstrel&rsquo;s
attire, sang a dirge accompanied by his lyre. He then threw
himself overboard; but instead of perishing, he was miraculously
borne up in safety by a dolphin, supposed to have been charmed
by the music. Thus he was conveyed to Taenarum, whence he
proceeded to Corinth, arriving before the ship from Tarentum.
Immediately on his arrival Arion related his story to Periander,
who was at first incredulous, but eventually learned the truth
by a stratagem. Summoning the sailors, he demanded what had
become of the poet. They affirmed that he had remained
behind at Tarentum; upon which they were suddenly confronted
by Arion himself, arrayed in the same garments in which he had
leapt overboard. The sailors confessed their guilt and were
punished. Arion&rsquo;s lyre and the dolphin were translated to the
stars. Herodotus and Pausanias (iii. 25. 7) both refer to a brass
figure at Taenarum which was supposed to represent Arion seated
on the dolphin&rsquo;s back. But this story is only one of several
in which the dolphin appears as saving the lives of favoured
heroes. For instance, it is curious that Taras, the mythical
founder of Tarentum, is said to have been conveyed in this
manner from Taenarum to Tarentum. On Tarentine coins a
man and dolphin appear, and hence it may be thought that
the monument at Taenarum represented Taras and not Arion.
At the same time the connexion of Apollo with the dolphin must
not be forgotten. Under this form the god appeared when he
founded the celebrated oracle at Delphi, the name of which
commemorates the circumstance. He was also the god of music,
the special preserver of poets, and to him the lyre was sacred.</p>

<div class="condensed">

mention may be made of the pretty ballad by A.W. Schlegel; see

<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">ARIOSTO, LODOVICO<a name="ar78" id="ar78"></a></span> (1474-1533) Italian poet, was born at
Reggio, in Lombardy, on the 8th of September 1474. His father
was Niccolo Ariosto, commander of the citadel of Reggio. He
showed a strong inclination to poetry from his earliest years,
but was obliged by his father to study the law&mdash;a pursuit in
which he lost five of the best years of his life. Allowed at last to
follow his inclination, he applied himself to the study of the
classics under Gregorio da Spoleto. But after a short time,
during which he read the best Latin authors, he was deprived of
his teacher by Gregorio&rsquo;s removal to France as tutor of Francesco
Sforza. Ariosto thus lost the opportunity of learning Greek,
as he intended. His father dying soon after, he was compelled
to forego his literary occupations to undertake the management of
the family, whose affairs were embarrassed, and to provide for
his nine brothers and sisters, one of whom was a cripple. He
wrote, however, about this time some comedies in prose and a
few lyrical pieces. Some of these attracted the notice of the
cardinal Ippolito d&rsquo;Este, who took the young poet under his
patronage and appointed him one of the gentlemen of his
household. This prince usurped the character of a patron of
literature, whilst the only reward which the poet received for
having dedicated to him the <i>Orlando Furioso</i>, was the question,
&ldquo;Where did you find so many stories, Master Ludovic?&rdquo; The
poet himself tells us that the cardinal was ungrateful; deplores
the time which he spent under his yoke; and adds, that if he
received some niggardly pension, it was not to reward him for
his poetry, which the prelate despised, but to make some just
compensation for the poet&rsquo;s running like a messenger, with the
risk of his life, at his eminence&rsquo;s pleasure. Nor was even this
miserable pittance regularly paid during the period that the
poet enjoyed it. The cardinal went to Hungary in 1518, and
wished Ariosto to accompany him. The poet excused himself,
pleading ill health, his love of study, the care of his private
affairs and the age of his mother, whom it would have been
disgraceful to leave. His excuses were not received, and even
an interview was denied him. Ariosto then boldly said, that
if his eminence thought to have bought a slave by assigning him
the scanty pension of 75 crowns a year, he was mistaken and
might withdraw his boon&mdash;which it seems the cardinal did.</p>

<p>The cardinal&rsquo;s brother, Alphonso, duke of Ferrara, now took
the poet under his patronage. This was but an act of simple
justice, Ariosto having already distinguished himself as a
diplomatist, chiefly on the occasion of two visits to Rome as
ambassador to Pope Julius II. The fatigue of one of these hurried
journeys brought on a complaint from which he never recovered;
and on his second mission he was nearly killed by order of the
violent pope, who happened at the time to be much incensed
against the duke of Ferrara. On account of the war, his salary
of only 84 crowns a year was suspended, and it was withdrawn
altogether after the peace; in consequence of which Ariosto
asked the duke either to provide for him, or to allow him to
seek employment elsewhere. A province, situated on the wildest
heights of the Apennines, being then without a governor, Ariosto
received the appointment, which he held for three years. The
office was no sinecure. The province was distracted by factions
and banditti, the governor had not the requisite means to enforce
his authority and the duke did little to support his minister.
Yet it is said that Ariosto&rsquo;s government satisfied both the sovereign
and the people confided to his care; and a story is added
of his having, when walking out alone, fallen in with a party
of banditti, whose chief, on discovering that his captive was
the author of <i>Orlando Furioso</i>, humbly apologized for not having
immediately shown him the respect which was due to his rank.
Although he had little reason to be satisfied with his office, he
refused an embassy to Pope Clement VII. offered to him by the
secretary of the duke, and spent the remainder of his life at
Ferrara, writing comedies, superintending their performance
as well as the construction of a theatre, and correcting his
<i>Orlando Furioso</i>, of which the complete edition was published
only a year before his death. He died of consumption on the
6th of June 1533.</p>

<p>That Ariosto was honoured and respected by the first men of
his age is a fact; that most of the princes of Italy showed him
great partiality is equally true; but it is not less so that their
patronage was limited to kind words. It is not known that he
ever received any substantial mark of their love for literature;
he lived and died poor. He proudly wrote on the entrance of a
house built by himself,</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page493" id="page493"></a>493</span></p>

<table class="reg" summary="poem"><tr><td> <div class="poemr">
<p>&ldquo;Parva, sed apta mihi, sed nulli obnoxia, sed non</p>
<p class="i1">Sordida, parta meo sed tamen aere domus;&rdquo;</p>
</div> </td></tr></table>

<p class="noind">which serves to show the incorrectness of the assertion of
flatterers, followed by Tiraboschi, that the duke of Ferrara built
that house for him. The only one who seems to have given
anything to Ariosto as a reward for his poetical talent was the
marquess del Vasto, who assigned him an annuity of 100 crowns
on the revenues of Casteleone in Lombardy; but it was only
paid, if ever, from the end of 1531. That he was crowned as poet
by Charles V. seems untrue, although a diploma may have been
issued to that effect by the emperor.</p>

<p>The character of Ariosto seems to have been fully and justly
delineated by Gabriele, his brother:&mdash;</p>

<table class="reg" summary="poem"><tr><td> <div class="poemr">
<p>&ldquo;Ornabat pietas et grata modestia Vatem,</p>
<p class="i05">Sancta fides, dictique memor, munitaque recto</p>

<p class="i05">Et constans virtus animi, et clementia mitis,</p>
<p class="i05">Ambitione procul pulsa, fastusque tumore.&rdquo;</p>
</div> </td></tr></table>

<p>His satires, in which we see him before us such as he was,
show that there was no flattery in this portrait. In these compositions
we are struck with the noble independence of the poet.
He loved liberty with a most jealous fondness. His disposition
was changeable withal, as he himself very frankly confesses in
his Latin verses, as well as in the satires.</p>

<table class="reg" summary="poem"><tr><td> <div class="poemr">
<p>&ldquo;Hoc olim ingenio vitales hausimus auras,</p>
<p class="i1">Multa cito ut placeant, displicitura brevi.</p>

<p class="noind">Hence he never would bind himself, either by going into orders,
or by marrying, till towards the end of his life, when he espoused
Alessandra, widow of Tito Strozzi. He had no issue by his wife,
but he left two natural sons by different mothers.</p>

<p>His Latin poems do not perhaps deserve to be noticed: in
the age of Flaminio, Vida, Fracastoro and Sannazaro, better
things were due from a poet like Ariosto. His lyrical compositions
show the poet, although they do not seem worthy of his
powers. His comedies, of which he wrote four, besides one which
he left unfinished, are avowedly imitated from Plautus and
Terence; and although native critics may admire in them the
elegance of the diction, the liveliness of the dialogue and the
novelty of some scenes, few will feel interest either in the subject
or in the characters, and it is hard to approve the immoral
passages by which they are disfigured, however grateful these
might be to the audiences and patrons of theatrical representations
in Ariosto&rsquo;s own day.</p>

<p>Of all the works of Ariosto, the most solid monument of his
fame is the <i>Orlando Furioso</i>, the extraordinary merits of which
have cast into oblivion the numberless romance poems which
inundated Italy during the 15th, 16th and 17th centuries.</p>

<p>The popularity which an earlier poem on the same theme,
<i>Orlando Innamorato</i>, by Boiardo, enjoyed in Ariosto&rsquo;s time,
cannot be well conceived, now that the enthusiasm of the
crusades, and the interest which was attached to a war against
the Moslems, have passed away. Boiardo wrote and read his
poem at the court of Ferrara, but died before he was able to
finish it. Many poets undertook the difficult task of its completion;
but it was reserved for Ariosto both to finish and to
surpass, his original. Boiardo did not, perhaps, yield to Ariosto
either in vigour or in richness of imagination, but he lived in
a less refined age, and died before he was able to recast or even
finish the poetical romance which he had written under the
impulse of his exuberant fancy. Ariosto, on the other hand,
united to a powerful imagination an elegant and cultivated taste.
He began to write his great poem about 1503, and after having
consulted the first men of the age of Leo X., he published it in
1516, in only 40 cantos (extended afterwards to 46); and up
to the moment of his death never ceased to correct and improve
both the subject and the style. It is in this latter quality that
he excels, and for which he had assigned him the name of <i>Divino
Lodovico</i>. Even when he jests, he never compromises his
dignity; and in pathetic description or narrative he excites
the reader&rsquo;s deepest feelings. In his machinery he displays a
vivacity of fancy with which no other poet can vie; but he
never lets his fancy carry him so far as to omit to employ, with
an art peculiar to himself, those simple and natural pencil-strokes
which, by imparting to the most extraordinary feats
a colour of reality, satisfy the reason without disenchanting the
imagination. The death of Zerbino, the complaints of Isabella,
the effects of discord among the Saracens, the flight of Astolfo
to the moon, the passion which causes Orlando&rsquo;s madness, teem
with beauties of every variety. The supposition that the poem
is not connected throughout is wholly unfounded; there is a
connexion which, with a little attention, will become evident.
The love of Ruggero and Bradamante forms the main subject
of the <i>Furioso</i>; every part of it, except some episodes,
depend upon this subject; and the poem ends with their marriage.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>The first complete edition of the <i>Orlando Furioso</i> was published
at Ferrara in 1532, as noted above. The edition of Morali (Milan,
1818) follows the text of the 1532 edition with great correctness.
Of editions published in England, those of Baskerville (Birmingham,
1773) and Panizzi (London, 1834) are the most important. The
indifferent translations into English of Sir John Harrington (1591)
and John Hoole (1783) have been superseded by the spirited rendering
of W. Stewart Rose (1823). See also E. Gardner, <i>Ariosto: the

<p><span class="bold">ARISTAEUS,<a name="ar80" id="ar80"></a></span> a divinity whose worship was widely spread
throughout ancient Greece, but concerning whom the myths
are somewhat obscure. The account most generally received
connects him specially with Thessaly. Apollo carried off from
Mount Pelion the nymph Cyrene, daughter or granddaughter of
the river-god Peneus, and conveyed her to Libya, where she gave
birth to Aristaeus. From this circumstance the town of Cyrene
took its name. The child was at first handed over to the care
of the Hours, or the nymph Melissa and the centaur Cheiron.
He afterwards left Libya and went to Thebes, where he received
instruction from the Muses in the arts of healing and prophecy,
and married Autonoe, daughter of Cadmus, by whom he had
several children, among others, the unfortunate Actaeon. He
is said to have visited Ceos, where, by erecting a temple to Zeus
Icmaeus (the giver of moisture), he freed the inhabitants from
a terrible drought. The islanders worshipped him, and occasionally
identified him with Zeus, calling him Zeus Aristaeus.
After travelling through many of the Aegean islands, through
Sicily, Sardinia and Magna Graecia, everywhere conferring
benefits and receiving divine honours, Aristaeus reached Thrace,
where he was initiated into the mysteries of Dionysus, and
finally disappeared near Mount Haemus. While in Thrace he is
said to have caused the death of Eurydice, who was bitten by
a snake while fleeing from him. Aristaeus was essentially a
benevolent deity; he was worshipped as the first who introduced
the cultivation of bees (Virgil, <i>Georg.</i> iv. 315-558), and of the
vine and olive; he was the protector of herdsmen and hunters;
he warded off the evil effects of the dog-star; he possessed the
arts of healing and prophecy. He was often identified with
Zeus, Apollo and Dionysus. In ancient sculptures and coins he
is represented as a young man, habited like a shepherd, and
sometimes carrying a sheep on his shoulders. Coins of Ceos
exhibit the head of Aristaeus and Sirius in the form of a dog
crowned with rays.</p>

<p><span class="bold">ARISTARCHUS,<a name="ar84" id="ar84"></a></span> of Samothrace (<i>c.</i> 220-143 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>), Greek grammarian
and critic, flourished about 155. He settled early in
Alexandria, where he studied under Aristophanes of Byzantium,
whom he succeeded as librarian of the museum. On the accession
of the tyrant Ptolemy Physcon (his former pupil), he found his
life in danger and withdrew to Cyprus, where he died from
dropsy, hastened, it is said, by voluntary starvation, at the age
of 72. Aristarchus founded a school of philologists, called after
him &ldquo;Aristarcheans,&rdquo; which long flourished in Alexandria and
afterwards at Rome. He is said to have written 800 commentaries
alone, without reckoning special treatises. He edited
Hesiod, Pindar, Aeschylus, Sophocles and other authors; but
his chief fame rests on his critical and exegetical edition of
Homer, practically the foundation of our present recension. In
the time of Augustus, two Aristarcheans, Didymus and Aristonicus,
undertook the revision of his work, and the extracts
from these two writers in the Venetian scholia to the <i>Iliad</i>
give an idea of Aristarchus&rsquo;s Homeric labours. To obtain a
thoroughly correct text, he marked with an obelus the lines
he considered spurious; other signs were used by him to indicate
notes, varieties of reading, repetitions and interpolations. He
arranged the <i>Iliad</i> and the <i>Odyssey</i> in twenty-four books as we
now have them. As a commentator his principle was that the
author should explain himself, without recourse to allegorical
interpretation; in grammar, he laid chief stress on analogy
and uniformity of usage and construction. His views were
opposed by Crates of Mallus, who wrote a treatise <span class="grk" title="Heri

Greece, said to have lived in the time of Cyrus and Croesus,
or, according to some, ca. 690 <span class="scs">B.C.</span> We are chiefly indebted
to Herodotus (iv. 13-15) for our knowledge of him and his poem
<i>Arimaspeia</i>. He belonged to a noble family of Proconnesus,
an island colony from Miletus in the Propontis, and was supposed
to be inspired by Apollo. He travelled through the
countries north and east of the Euxine, and visited the
Hyperboreans, Issedonians and Arimaspians, who fought against the
gold-guarding griffins. An important historical fact which
seems to be indicated in his poem is the rush of barbarian hordes
towards Europe under pressure from their neighbours. Twelve
lines of the poem are preserved in Tzetzes and Longinus.
Wonderful stories are told of Aristeas. At Proconnesus, he fell
dead in a shop; simultaneously a traveller declared he had
spoken with him near Cyzicus; his body vanished; six years
afterwards, he returned. Again disappearing, 240 years later
he was at Metapontum, and commanded the inhabitants to
raise a statue to himself and an altar to Apollo, whom he had
accompanied in the form of a raven, at the founding of the city.
According to Suidas, Aristeas also wrote a prose theogony.
The genuineness of his works is disputed by Dionysius of
Halicarnassus.</p>

called &ldquo;the Just,&rdquo; was the son of Lysimachus, and a member
of a family of moderate fortune. Of his early life we are told
merely that he became a follower of the statesman Cleisthenes
and sided with the aristocratic party in Athenian politics.
He first comes into notice as strategus in command of his native
tribe Antiochis at Marathon, and it was no doubt in consequence
of the distinction which he then achieved that he was elected
chief archon for the ensuing year (489-488). In pursuance of
his conservative policy which aimed at maintaining Athens as
a land power, he was one of the chief opponents of the naval
policy of Themistocles (<i>q.v.</i>). The conflict between the two
leaders ended in the ostracism of Aristides, at a date variously
given between 485 and 482. It is said that, on this occasion,
a voter, who did not know him, came up to him, and giving
him his sherd, desired him to write upon it the name of Aristides.
The latter asked if Aristides had wronged him. &ldquo;No,&rdquo; was
the reply, &ldquo;and I do not even know him, but it irritates me to
hear him everywhere called <i>the just</i>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Early in 480 Aristides profited by the decree recalling the
post-Marathonian exiles to help in the defence of Athens against
the Persian invaders, and was elected strategus for the year
480-479. In the campaign of Salamis he rendered loyal support
to Themistocles, and crowned the victory by landing Athenian
infantry on the island of Psyttaleia and annihilating the Persian
garrison stationed there (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Salamis</a></span>). In 479 he was re-elected
strategus, and invested with special powers as commander of
the Athenian contingent at Plataea; he is also said to have
judiciously suppressed a conspiracy among some oligarchic
malcontents in the army, and to have played a prominent part
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page495" id="page495"></a>495</span>
in arranging for the celebration of the victory. In 478 or
477 Aristides was in command of the Athenian squadron off
Byzantium, and so far won the confidence of the Ionian allies
that, after revolting from the Spartan admiral Pausanias, they
offered him the chief command and left him with absolute
discretion in fixing the contributions of the newly formed
confederacy (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Delian League</a></span>). His assessment was universally
accepted as equitable, and continued as the basis of taxation
for the greater part of the league&rsquo;s duration; it was probably
from this that he won the title of &ldquo;the Just.&rdquo; Aristides soon
left the command of the fleet to his friend Cimon (<i>q.v.</i>), but
continued to hold a predominant position in Athens. At first
he seems to have remained on good terms with Themistocles,
whom he is said to have helped in outwitting the Spartans over
the rebuilding of the walls of Athens. But in spite of statements
in which ancient authors have represented Aristides as
a democratic reformer, it is certain that the period following
the Persian wars during which he shaped Athenian policy was
one of conservative reaction. (For the theory based on Plutarch,
<i>Aristid.</i> 22, that Aristides after Plataea threw open the
archonship to all the citizens, see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Archon</a></span>.)</p>

<p>He is said by some authorities to have died at Athens, by
others on a journey to the Euxine sea. The date of his death
is given by Nepos as 468; at any rate he lived to witness the
ostracism of Themistocles, towards whom he always displayed
a generous conduct, but had died before the rise of Pericles.
His estate seems to have suffered severely from the Persian
invasions, for apparently he did not leave enough money to
defray the expenses of his burial, and it is known that his
descendants even in the 4th century received state pensions.

<p><span class="bold">ARISTIDES, AELIUS,<a name="ar90" id="ar90"></a></span> surnamed <span class="sc">Theodorus</span>, Greek rhetorician
and sophist, son of Eudaemon, a priest of Zeus, was born
at Hadriani in Mysia, <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 117 (or 129). He studied under
Herodes Atticus of Athens, Polemon of Smyrna, and Alexander of
Cotyaeum, in whose honour he composed a funeral oration still
extant. In the practice of his calling he travelled through
Greece, Italy, Egypt and Asia, and in many places the
inhabitants erected statues to him in recognition of his talents.
In 156 he was attacked by an illness which lasted thirteen years,
the nature of which has caused considerable speculation. However,
it in no way interfered with his studies; in fact, they were
prescribed as part of his cure. Aristides&rsquo; favourite place of
residence was Smyrna. In 178, when it was destroyed by an
earthquake, he wrote an account of the disaster to Aurelius,
which deeply affected the emperor and induced him to rebuild
the city. The grateful inhabitants set up a statue in honour of
Aristides, and styled him the &ldquo;builder&rdquo; of Smyrna. He refused
all honours from them except that of priest of Asclepius, which
office he held till his death, about 189. The extant works of
Aristides consist of two small rhetorical treatises and fifty-five
declamations, some not really speeches at all. The treatises are
on <i>political</i> and <i>simple speech</i>, in which he takes Demosthenes
and Xenophon as models for illustration; some critics attribute
these to a later compiler (Spengel, <i>Rhetores Graeci</i>). The six
<i>Sacred Discourses</i> have attracted some attention. They give a
full account of his protracted illness, including a mass of superstitious
details of visions, dreams and wonderful cures, which
the god Asclepius ordered him to record. These cures, from his
account, offer similarities to the effects produced by hypnotism.
The speeches proper are epideictic or show speeches&mdash;on certain
gods, panegyrics of the emperor and individual cities (Smyrna,
Rome); justificatory&mdash;the attack on Plato&rsquo;s <i>Gorgias</i> in defence
of rhetoric and the four statesmen, Thucydides, Miltiades,
Pericles, Cimon; symbouleutic or political, the subjects being
taken from the past history of free Greece&mdash;the Sicilian expedition,
peace negotiations with Sparta, the political situation after
the battle of Leuctra. The <i>Panathenaicus</i> and <i>Encomium of
Rome</i> were actually delivered, the former imitated from Isocrates.
The <i>Leptinea</i>&mdash;the genuineness of which is disputed&mdash;contrast
unfavourably with the speech of Demosthenes. Aristides&rsquo; works
were highly esteemed by his contemporaries; they were much
used for school instruction, and distinguished rhetoricians wrote
commentaries upon them. His style, formed on the best models,
is generally clear and correct, though sometimes obscured by
rhetorical ornamentation; his subjects being mainly fictitious,
the cause possessed no living interest, and his attention was
concentrated on form and diction.</p>

<p><span class="bold">ARISTIDES, APOLOGY OF<a name="ar92" id="ar92"></a></span>. Until 1878 our knowledge of the
early Christian writer Aristides was confined to the statement of
Eusebius that he was an Athenian philosopher, who presented an
apology &ldquo;concerning the faith&rdquo; to the emperor Hadrian. In
that year, however, the Mechitharists of S. Lazzaro at Venice
published a fragment in Armenian<a name="fa1g" id="fa1g" href="#ft1g"><span class="sp">1</span></a> from the beginning of the apology;
and in 1889 Dr Rendel Harris found the whole of it in a
Syriac version on Mount Sinai. While his edition was passing
through the press, it was observed by the present writer that all
the while the work had been in our hands in Greek, though in a
slightly abbreviated form, as it had been imbedded as a speech
in a religious novel written about the 6th century, and entitled
&ldquo;The Life of Barlaam and Josaphat.&rdquo; The discovery of the
Syriac version reopened the question of the date of the work.
For although its title there corresponds to that given by the
Armenian fragment and by Eusebius, it begins with a formal
inscription to &ldquo;the emperor Titus Hadrianus Antoninus
Augustus Pius&rdquo;; and Dr R. Harris is followed by Harnack and
others in supposing that it was only through a careless reading
of this inscription that the work was supposed to have been
addressed to Hadrian. If this be the case, it must be placed
somewhere in the long reign of Antoninus Pius (138-161).
There are, however, no internal grounds for rejecting the thrice-attested
dedication to Hadrian his predecessor, and the picture of
primitive Christian life which is here found points to the earlier
rather than to the later date. It is possible that the Apology was
read to Hadrian in person when he visited Athens, and that the
Syriac inscription was prefixed by a scribe on the analogy of
Justin&rsquo;s Apology, a mistake being made in the amplification of
Hadrian&rsquo;s name.</p>

<p>The Apology opens thus: &ldquo;I, O king, by the providence of
God came into the world; and having beheld the heaven, and
the earth, and the sea, the sun and moon, and all besides, I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page496" id="page496"></a>496</span>
marvelled at their orderly disposition; and seeing the world and
all things in it, that it is moved by compulsion, I understood that
He that moveth and governeth it is God. For whatsoever
moveth is stronger than that which is moved, and whatsoever
governeth is stronger than that which is governed.&rdquo; Having
briefly spoken of the divine nature in the terms of Greek philosophy,
Aristides proceeds to ask which of all the races of men
have at all partaken of the truth about God. Here we have the
first attempt at a systematic comparison of ancient religions.
For the purpose of his inquiry he adopts an obvious threefold
division into idolaters, Jews and Christians. Idolaters, or, as he
more gently terms them in addressing the emperor, &ldquo;those who
worship what among you are said to be gods,&rdquo; he subdivides
into the three great world-civilizations&mdash;Chaldeans, Greeks and
Egyptians. He chooses this order so as to work up to a climax
of error and absurdity in heathen worship. The direct nature-worship
of the Chaldeans is shown to be false because its objects
are works of the Creator, fashioned for the use of men. They obey
fixed laws and have no power over themselves. &ldquo;The Greeks
have erred worse than the Chaldeans ... calling those gods who
are no gods, according to their evil lusts, in order that having
these as advocates of their wickedness they may commit adultery,
and plunder and kill, and do the worst of deeds.&rdquo; The gods of
Olympus are challenged one by one, and shown to be either vile or
helpless, or both at once. A heaven of quarrelling divinities
cannot inspire a reasonable worship. These gods are not even
respectable; how can they be adorable? &ldquo;The Egyptians have
erred worse than all the nations; for they were not content with
the worships of the Chaldeans and Greeks, but introduced,
moreover, as gods even brute beasts of the dry land and of the
waters, and plants and herbs.... Though they see their gods
eaten by others and by men, and burned, and slain, and rotting,
they do not understand concerning them that they are no
gods.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Throughout the whole of the argument there is strong common-sense
and a stern severity unrelieved by conscious humour.
Aristides is engaged in a real contest; he strikes hard blows, and
gives no quarter. He cannot see, as Justin and Clement see,
a striving after truth, a feeling after God, in the older religions,
or even in the philosophies of Greece. He has no patience with
attempts to find a deeper meaning in the stories of the gods.
&ldquo;Do they say that one nature underlies these diverse forms?
Then why does god hate god, or god kill god? Do they say
that the histories are mythical? Then the gods themselves
are myths, and nothing more.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Jews are briefly treated. After a reference to their
descent from Abraham and their sojourn in Egypt, Aristides
praises them for their worship of the one God, the Almighty
Creator; but blames them as worshipping angels, and observing
&ldquo;sabbaths and new moons, and the unleavened bread, and the
great fast, and circumcision, and cleanness of meats.&rdquo; He then
proceeds to the description of the Christians. He begins with a
statement which, when purged of glosses by a comparison of
the three forms in which it survives, reads thus: &ldquo;Now the
Christians reckon their race from the Lord Jesus Christ; and
He is confessed to be the Son of God Most High. Having by the
Holy Spirit come down from heaven, and having been born of
a Hebrew virgin, He took flesh and appeared unto men, to call
them back from their error of many gods; and having completed
His wonderful dispensation, He was pierced by the Jews, and
after three days He revived and went up to heaven. And the
glory of His coming thou canst learn, O king, from that which
is called among them the evangelic scripture, if thou wilt read it.
He bad twelve disciples, who after His ascent into heaven went
forth into the provinces of the world and taught His greatness;
whence they who at this day believe their preaching are called
Christians.&rdquo; This passage contains striking correspondences
with the second section of the Apostles&rsquo; Creed. The attribution
of the Crucifixion to the Jews appears in several 2nd-century
documents; Justin actually uses the words &ldquo;He was pierced
by you&rdquo; in his dialogue with Trypho the Jew.</p>

<p>&ldquo;These are they,&rdquo; he proceeds, &ldquo;who beyond all the nations
of the earth have found the truth: for they know God as Creator
and Maker of all things, and they worship no other god beside
Him; for they have His commandments graven on their hearts,
and these they keep in expectation of the world to come....
Whatsoever they would not should be done unto them, they do
not to another.... He that hath supplieth him that hath not
without grudging: if they see a stranger they bring him under
their roof, and rejoice over him, as over a brother indeed, for they
call not one another brethren after the flesh, but after the spirit.
They are ready for Christ&rsquo;s sake to give up their own lives; for
His commandments they securely keep, living holily and righteously,
according as the Lord their God hath commanded them,
giving thanks to Him at all hours, over all their food and drink,
and the rest of their good things.&rdquo; This simple description is
fuller in the Syriac, but the additional details must be accepted
with caution: for while it is likely that the monk who appropriated
the Greek may have cut it down to meet the exigencies
of his romance, it is the habit of certain Syriac translators to
elaborate their originals. After asserting that &ldquo;this is the way
of truth,&rdquo; and again referring for further information to &ldquo;the
writings of the Christians,&rdquo; he says: &ldquo;And truly this is a new
race, and there is something divine mingled with it.&rdquo; At the
close we have a passage which is found only in the Syriac, but
which is shown by internal evidence to contain original elements:
&ldquo;The Greeks, because they practise foul things ... turn the
ridicule of their foulness upon the Christians.&rdquo; This is an allusion
to the charges of Thyestean banquets and other immoralities,
which the early apologists constantly rebut. &ldquo;But the Christians
offer up prayers for them, that they may turn from their error;
and when one of them turns, he is ashamed before the Christians
of the deeds that were done by him, and he confesses to God
saying: &lsquo;In ignorance I did these things&rsquo;; and he cleanses his
heart, and his sins are forgiven him, because he did them in
ignorance in former time, when he was blaspheming the true
knowledge of the Christians.&rdquo;</p>

<p>These last words point to the use in the composition of this
Apology of a lost apocryphal work of very early date, <i>The Preaching
of Peter</i>. This book is known to us chiefly by quotations
in Clement of Alexandria: it was widely circulated, and at one
time claimed a place within the Canon. It was used by the
Gnostic Heracleon and probably by the unknown writer of the
epistle to Diognetus. From the fragments which survive we
see that it contained: (1) a description of the nature of God,
which closely corresponds with Arist. i., followed by (2) a warning
not to worship according to the Greeks, with an exposure of
various forms of idolatry; (3) a warning not to worship according
to the Jews&mdash;although they alone think they know the true God&mdash;for
they worship angels and are superstitious about moons
and sabbaths, and feasts, comp. Arist. xiv.; (4) a description
of the Christians as being &ldquo;a third race,&rdquo; and worshipping God
in &ldquo;a new way&rdquo; through Christ; (5) a proof of Christianity
from Jewish prophecy; (6) a promise of forgiveness to Jews
and Gentiles who should turn to Christ, because they had sinned
&ldquo;in ignorance&rdquo; in the former time. Now all these points, except
the proof from Jewish prophecy, are taken up and worked out
by Aristides with a frequent use of the actual language of
<i>The Preaching of Peter</i>. A criterion is thus given us for the
reconstruction of the Apology, where the Greek which we have
has been abbreviated, and we are enabled to claim with certainty
some passages of the Syriac which might otherwise be suspected
as interpolations.</p>

<p>The style of the Apology is exceedingly simple. It is curiously
misdescribed by Jerome, who never can have seen it, as
&ldquo;Apologeticum pro Christianis contextum philosophorum sententiis.&rdquo;
Its merits are its recognition of the helplessness of the old
heathenism to satisfy human aspiration after the divine, and
the impressive simplicity with which it presents the unfailing
argument of the lives of Christians.</p>

<p><span class="bold">ARISTIPPUS<a name="ar93" id="ar93"></a></span> (<i>c.</i> 435-356 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>), Greek philosopher, the founder
of the Cyrenaic school, was the son of Aritadas, a merchant of
Cyrene. At an early age he came to Athens, and was induced
to remain by the fame of Socrates, whose pupil he became.
Subsequently he travelled through a number of Grecian cities,
and finally settled in Cyrene, where he founded his school.
His philosophy was eminently practical (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Cyrenaics</a></span>).
Starting from the two Socratic principles of virtue and happiness,
he emphasized the second, and made pleasure the criterion
of life. That he held to be good which gives the maximum
of pleasure. In pursuance of this he indulged in all forms of
external luxury. At the same time he remained thoroughly
master of himself and had the self-control to refrain or to enjoy.
Diogenes Laertius (ii. 65), quoting Phanias the peripatetic, says
that he received money for his teaching, and Aristotle (<i>Met</i>. ii. 2)
expressly calls him a sophist. Diogenes further states that he
wrote several treatises, but none have survived. The five
letters attributed to him are undoubtedly spurious. His
daughter Arete, and her son Aristippus (<span class="grk" title="maetrodidaktos">&#956;&#951;&#964;&#961;&#959;&#948;&#943;&#948;&#945;&#954;&#964;&#959;&#962;</span>, &ldquo;pupil
of his mother&rdquo;), carried on the school after his death. A
cosmopolitan on principle, and a convinced disbeliever in the
ethics of his day, he comes very near to modern empiricism and
especially to the modern Hedonist school.</p>

and pupil of Zeno. He differed from Zeno on many points,
and approximated more closely to the Cynic school. He was
eloquent (hence his nickname &ldquo;the Siren&rdquo;) but controversial
in tone. He despised logic, and rejected the philosophy of nature
as beyond the powers of man. Ethics alone he considered
worthy of study, and in that only general and theoretical
questions. He rejected Zeno&rsquo;s doctrine of desirable things,
intermediate between virtue and vice. There is only one virtue&mdash;a
clear, intelligent, healthy state of mind (<i>hygeia</i>). Aristo is
frequently confounded with another philosopher of the same
name, Ariston of Iulis, in Ceos, who, about 230 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>, succeeded

led. Aristo is cited by Eusebius (<i>Hist. Eccl.</i> iv. 6. 3) for a decree

writer of a <i>Dialogue</i> (between Papiscus, an Alexandrian Jew,
and Jason, who represents the author) on the witness of prophecy

Ptolemy X. Philometor (end of 2nd century), Anatolius in that
of Ptolemy II. Philadelphus, but the middle of the 2nd century
is more probable. He was among the earliest of the Jewish-Alexandrian
philosophers whose aim was to reconcile and
identify Greek philosophical conceptions with the Jewish religion.
Only a few fragments of his work, apparently entitled <i>Commentaries
on the Writings of Moses</i>, are quoted by Clement, Eusebius
and other theological writers, but they suffice to show its object.
He endeavoured to prove that early Greek philosophers had
borrowed largely from certain parts of Scripture, and quoted
from Linus, Orpheus, Musaeus and others, passages which
strongly resemble the Mosaic writings. These passages, however,
were obvious forgeries. It is suggested that the name Aristobulus
was taken from 2 Macc. i. 10. The hypothesis (Schlatter,
<i>Das neugefundene hebräische Stück des Sirach</i>) that it was from
Aristobulus that the philosophy of <i>Ecclesiasticus</i> was derived

etymologically, the &ldquo;rule of the best,&rdquo; a form of government
variously defined and appreciated at different times and by
different authorities. In Greek political philosophy, aristocracy
is the government of those who most nearly attain to the ideal
of human perfection. Thus Plato in the <i>Republic</i> advocates
the rule of the &ldquo;philosopher-king&rdquo; who, in the social scheme,
is analogous to Reason in the intellectual, and alone is qualified
to control the active principles, <i>i.e.</i> the fighting population and
the artisans or workers. Aristocracy is thus the government
by those who are superior both morally and intellectually, and,
therefore, govern directly in the interests of the governed, as
a good doctor works for the good of his patient. Aristotle
classified good governments under three heads&mdash;monarchy,
aristocracy and commonwealth <span class="grk" title="politeia">&#960;&#959;&#955;&#953;&#964;&#949;&#943;&#945;</span>, to which he opposed
the three perverted forms&mdash;tyranny or absolutism, oligarchy
and democracy or mob-rule. The distinction between aristocracy
and oligarchy, which are both necessarily the rule of the few,
is that whereas the few <span class="grk" title="aristoi">&#7940;&#961;&#953;&#963;&#964;&#959;&#953;</span> will govern unselfishly, the
oligarchs, being the few wealthy (&ldquo;plutocracy&rdquo; in modern
terminology), will allow their personal interests to predominate.
While Plato&rsquo;s aristocracy might be the rule of the wise and
benevolent despot, Aristotle&rsquo;s is necessarily the rule of the few.</p>

<p>Historically aristocracy develops from primitive monarchy
by the gradual progressive limitation of the regal authority.
This process is effected primarily by the nobles who have hitherto
formed the council of the king (an excellent example will be found
in Athenian politics, see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Archon</a></span>), whose triple prerogative&mdash;
religious, military and judicial&mdash;is vested, <i>e.g.</i>, in a magistracy of
three. These are either members of the royal house or the heads
of noble families, and are elected for life or periodically by their
peers, <i>i.e.</i> by the old royal council (cf. the Areopagus at Athens,
the Senate at Rome), now the sovereign power. In practice
this council depends primarily on a birth qualification, and thus
has always been more or less inferior to the Aristotelian ideal;
it is, by definition, an &ldquo;oligarchy&rdquo; of birth, and is recruited
from the noble families, generally by the addition of emeritus
magistrates. From the earliest times, therefore, the word
&ldquo;aristocracy&rdquo; became practically synonymous with &ldquo;oligarchy,&rdquo;
and as such it is now generally used in opposition to democracy
(which similarly took the place of Aristotle&rsquo;s <span class="grk" title="politeia">&#960;&#959;&#955;&#953;&#964;&#949;&#943;&#945;</span>), in which
the ultimate sovereignty resides in the whole citizen body.</p>

<p>The aristocracy of which we know most in ancient Greece
was that of Athens prior to the reforms of Cleisthenes, but all
the Greek city-states passed through a period of aristocratic
or oligarchic government. Rome, between the regal and the
imperial periods, was always more or less under the aristocratic
government of the senate, in spite of the gradual growth of
democratic institutions (the Lat. <i>optimates</i> is the equivalent
of <span class="grk" title="aristoi">&#7940;&#961;&#953;&#963;&#964;&#959;&#953;</span>). There is, however, one feature which distinguishes
these aristocracies from those of modern states, namely, that
they were all slave-owning. The original relation of the slave-population,
which in many cases outnumbered the free citizens,
cannot always be discovered. But in some cases we know that
the slaves were the original inhabitants who had been overcome
by an influx of racially different invaders (cf. Sparta with its
Helots); in others they were captives taken in war. Hence even
the most democratic states of antiquity were so far aristocratic
that the larger proportion of the inhabitants had no voice in the
government. In the second place this relation gave rise to a
philosophic doctrine, held even by Aristotle, that there were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page498" id="page498"></a>498</span>
peoples who were inferior by nature and adapted to submission
(<span class="grk" title="phusei douloi">&#934;&#973;&#963;&#949;&#953; &#948;&#959;&#8166;&#955;&#959;&#953;</span>); such people had no &ldquo;virtue&rdquo; in the technical
civic sense, and were properly occupied in performing the menial
functions of society, under the control of the <span class="grk" title="aristoi">&#7940;&#961;&#953;&#963;&#964;&#959;&#953;</span>. Thus,
combined with the criteria of descent, civic status and the
ownership of the land, there was the further idea of intellectual
and social superiority. These qualifications were naturally, in
course of time, shared by an increasingly large number of the
lower class who broke down the barriers of wealth and education.
From this stage the transition is easy to the aristocracy of
wealth, such as we find at Carthage and later at Venice, in periods
when the importance of commerce was paramount and mercantile
pursuits had cast off the stigma of inferiority (in Gr. <span class="grk" title="banausia">&#946;&#945;&#957;&#945;&#965;&#963;&#943;&#945;</span>).</p>

<p>It is important at this stage to distinguish between aristocracy
and the feudal governments of medieval Europe. In these it is
true that certain power was exercised by a small number of
families, at the expense of the majority. But under this system
each noble governed in a particular area and within strict
limitations imposed by his sovereign; no sovereign authority
was vested in the nobles collectively.</p>

<p>Under the conditions of the present day the distinction
of aristocracy, democracy and monarchy cannot be rigidly
maintained from a purely governmental point of view. In no
case does the sovereign power in a state reside any longer in an
aristocracy, and the word has acquired a social rather than a
political sense as practically equivalent to &ldquo;nobility,&rdquo; though
the distinction is sometimes drawn between the &ldquo;aristocracy
of birth&rdquo; and the &ldquo;aristocracy of wealth.&rdquo; Modern history,
however, furnishes many examples of government in the hands
of an aristocracy. Such were the aristocratic republics of Venice,
Genoa and the Dutch Netherlands, and those of the free imperial
cities in Germany. Such, too, in practice though not in theory,
was the government of Great Britain from the Revolution of
1689 to the Reform Bill of 1832. The French nobles of the
<i>Ancien Régime</i>, denounced as &ldquo;aristocrats&rdquo; by the Revolutionists,
had no share as such in government, but enjoyed exceptional
privileges (<i>e.g.</i> exemption from taxation). This privileged position
is still enjoyed by the heads of the German mediatized
families of the &ldquo;High Nobility.&rdquo; In Great Britain, on the other
hand, though the aristocratic principle is still represented in the
constitution by the House of Lords, the &ldquo;aristocracy&rdquo; generally,
apart from the peers, has no special privileges.</p>

<p><span class="bold">ARISTODEMUS<a name="ar99" id="ar99"></a></span> (8th century <span class="scs">B.C.</span>), semi-legendary ruler of
Messenia in the time of the first Messenian War. Tradition
relates that, after some six years&rsquo; fighting, the Messenians were
forced to retire to the fortified summit of Ithome. The Delphic
oracle bade them sacrifice a virgin of the house of Aepytus.
Aristodemus offered his own daughter, and when her lover,
hoping to save her life, declared that she was no longer a maiden,
he slew her with his own hand to prove the assertion false.
In the thirteenth year of the war, Euphaes, the Messenian king,
died. As he left no children, popular election was resorted
to, and Aristodemus was chosen as his successor, though the
national soothsayers objected to him as the murderer of his
daughter. As a ruler he was mild and conciliatory. He was
victorious in the pitched battle fought at the foot of Ithome
in the fifth year of his reign, a battle in which the Messenians,
reinforced by the entire Arcadian levy and picked contingents
from Argos and Sicyon, defeated the combined Spartan and
Corinthian forces. Shortly afterwards, however, led by unfavourable
omens to despair of final success, he killed himself on his
daughter&rsquo;s tomb. Though little is known of his life and the
chronology is uncertain, yet Aristodemus may fairly be regarded
as a historical character. His reign is dated 731-724 <span class="scs">B.C.</span> by
Pausanias, and this may be taken as approximately correct,
though Duncker (<i>History of Greece</i>, Eng. trans., ii. p. 69) inclines
to place it eight years later.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>Pausanias iv. 9-13 is practically our only authority. He followed
as his chief source the prose history of Myron of Priene, an untrustworthy
writer, probably of the 2nd century <span class="scs">B.C.</span>; hence a good deal of
his story must be regarded as fanciful, though we cannot distinguish
accurately between the true and the fictitious.</p>

allusion to its repute in promoting child-birth), a genus of shrubs
or herbs of the natural order Aristolochiaceae, often with climbing
stems, found chiefly in the tropics. The flower forms a tube
inflated at the base. <i>A. Clematitis</i>, birthwort, is a central and
southern European species, found sometimes in England apparently
wild on ruins and similar places, but not a native. <i>A.

as a garden plant. The flower is bent like a pipe.</p>

<p>A member of the same order is the <i>asarabacca</i> (<i>Asarum europaeum</i>),
a small creeping herb with kidney-shaped leaves and
small purplish bell-shaped flowers. It is a native of the woods
of Europe and north temperate Asia, and occurs wild in some
English counties. It was formerly grown for medicinal purposes,
the underground stem having cathartic and emetic
properties. An allied species, <i>A. canadense</i>, is the Canadian

<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">ARISTOMENES,<a name="ar101" id="ar101"></a></span> of Andania, the semi-legendary hero of the
second Messenian war. He was a member of the Aepytid family,
the son of Nicomedes (or, according to another version, of
Pyrrhus) and Nicoteleia, and took a prominent part in stirring
up the revolt against Sparta and securing the co-operation of
Argos and Arcadia. He showed such heroism in the first
encounter, at Derae, that the crown was offered him, but he would
accept only the title of commander-in-chief. His daring is
illustrated by the story that he came by night to the temple of
Athene &ldquo;of the Brazen House&rdquo; at Sparta, and there set up his
shield with the inscription, &ldquo;Dedicated to the goddess by
Aristomenes from the Spartans.&rdquo; His prowess contributed
largely to the Messenian victory over the Spartan and Corinthian
forces at &ldquo;The Boar&rsquo;s Barrow&rdquo; in the plain of Stenyclarus,
but in the following year the treachery of the Arcadian king
Aristocrates caused the Messenians to suffer a crushing defeat
at &ldquo;The Great Trench.&rdquo; Aristomenes and the survivors retired
to the mountain stronghold of Eira, where they defied the
Spartans for eleven years. On one of his raids he and fifty of his
companions were captured and thrown into the Caeadas, the
chasm on Mt. Taygetus into which criminals were cast. Aristomenes
alone was saved, and soon reappeared at Eira: legend
told how he was upheld in his fall by an eagle and escaped by
grasping the tail of a fox, which led him to the hole by which
it had entered. On another occasion he was captured during
a truce by some Cretan auxiliaries of the Spartans, and was
released only by the devotion of a Messenian girl who afterwards
became his daughter-in-law. At length Eira was betrayed
to the Spartans (668 <span class="scs">B.C.</span> according to Pausanias), and after a
heroic resistance Aristomenes and his followers had to evacuate
Messenia and seek a temporary refuge with their Arcadian
allies. A desperate plan to seize Sparta itself was foiled by
Aristocrates, who paid with his life for his treachery.
Aristomenes retired to Ialysus in Rhodes, where Damagetus, his
son-in-law, was king, and died there while planning a journey
to Sardis and Ecbatana to seek aid from the Lydian and Median
sovereigns (Pausanias iv. 14-24). Another tradition represents
him as captured and slain by the Spartans during the war
(Pliny, <i>Nat. Hist.</i> xi. 187; Val. Maximus i. 8, 15; Steph.
Byzant. s.v. <span class="grk" title="Andania">&#902;&#957;&#948;&#945;&#957;&#943;&#945;</span>). Though there seems to be no conclusive
reason for doubting the existence of Aristomenes, his history,
as related by Pausanias, following mainly the <i>Messeniaca</i> of
the Cretan epic poet Rhianus (about 230 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>), is evidently
largely interwoven with fictions. These probably arose after
the foundation of Messene in 369 <span class="scs">B.C.</span> Aristomenes&rsquo; statue
was set up in the stadium there: his bones were fetched from
Rhodes and placed in a tomb surmounted by a column (Paus. iv.
32. 3, 6); and more than five centuries later we still find heroic
honours paid to him, and his exploits a popular subject of song
(<i>ib</i>. iv. 14. 7; 16. 6).</p>

<p><span class="bold">ARISTOPHANES<a name="ar103" id="ar103"></a></span> (<i>c.</i> 448-385 <span class="scs">B.C.</span><a name="fa1h" id="fa1h" href="#ft1h"><span class="sp">1</span></a>), the great comic dramatist
and poet of Athens. His birth-year is uncertain. He is known
to have been about the same age as Eupolis, and is said to have
been &ldquo;almost a boy&rdquo; when his first comedy (<i>The Banqueters</i>)
was brought out in 427 <span class="scs">B.C.</span> His father Philippus was a landowner
in Aegina. Aristophanes was an Athenian citizen of the tribe
Pandionis, and the deme Cydathene. The stories which made
him a native of Camirus in Rhodes, or of the Egyptian Naucratis,
had probably no other foundation than an indictment for usurpation
of civic rights (<span class="grk" title="xenias graphae">&#958;&#949;&#957;&#943;&#945;&#962; &#947;&#961;&#945;&#966;&#942;</span>) which appears to have been
more than once laid against him by Cleon. His three sons&mdash;
Philippus, Araros and Nicostratus&mdash;were all comic poets.
Philippus, the eldest, was a rival of Eubulus, who began to exhibit
in 376 <span class="scs">B.C.</span> Araros brought out two of his father&rsquo;s latest
comedies&mdash;the <i>Cocalus</i> and the <i>Aeolosicon</i>, and in 375 began to
exhibit works of his own. Nicostratus, the youngest, is assigned
by Athenaeus to the Middle Comedy, but belongs, as is shown by
some of the names and characters of his pieces, to the New
Comedy also.</p>

<p>Although tragedy and comedy had their common origin in
the festivals of Dionysus, the regular establishment of tragedy
at Athens preceded by half a century that of comedy. The Old
Comedy may be said to have lasted about eighty years (470-390
<span class="scs">B.C.</span>), and to have flourished about fifty-six (460-404 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>).
Of the forty poets who are named as having illustrated it the
chief were Cratinus, Eupolis and Aristophanes. The Middle
Comedy covers a period of about seventy years (390-320 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>),
its chief poets being Antiphanes, Alexis, Theopompus and
Strattis. The New Comedy was in vigour for about seventy years
(320-250 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>), having for its foremost representatives Menander,
Philemon and Diphilus. The Old Comedy was possible only for
a thorough democracy. Its essence was a satirical censorship,
unsparing in personalities, of public and of private life&mdash;of
morality, of statesmanship, of education, of literature, of social
usage&mdash;in a word, of everything which had an interest for the
city or which could amuse the citizens. Preserving all the freedom
of banter and of riotous fun to which its origin gave it an
historical right, it aimed at associating with this a strong practical
purpose&mdash;the expression of a democratic public opinion in such
a form that no misconduct or folly could altogether disregard it.
That licentiousness, that grossness of allusion which too often
disfigures it, was, it should be remembered, exacted by the
sentiment of the Dionysiac festivals, as much as a decorous
cheerfulness is expected at the holiday times of other worships.
This was the popular element. Without this the entertainment
would have been found flat and unseasonable. But for a comic
poet of the higher calibre the consciousness of a recognized power
which he could exert, and the desire to use this power for the
good of the city, must always have been the uppermost feelings.
At Athens the poet of the Old Comedy had an influence analogous,
perhaps, rather to that of the journalist than to that of the
modern dramatist. But the established type of Dionysiac
comedy gave him an instrument such as no public satirist has
ever wielded. When Molière wished to brand hypocrisy he
could only make his Tartuffe the central figure of a regular
drama, developed by a regular process to a just catastrophe.
He had no choice between touching too lightly and using sustained
force to make a profound impression. The Athenian
dramatist of the Old Comedy worked under no such limitations
of form. The wildest flights of extravagance were permitted
to him. Nothing bound him to a dangerous emphasis or a
wearisome insistence. He could deal the keenest thrust, or
make the most earnest appeal, and at the next moment&mdash;if his
instinct told him that it was time to change the subject&mdash;vary
the serious strain by burlesque. He had, in short, an incomparable
scope for trenchant satire directed by sure tact.</p>

<p>Aristophanes is for us the representative of the Old Comedy.
But his genius, while it includes, also transcends the genius of
the Old Comedy. He can denounce the frauds of a Cleon, he can
vindicate the duty of Athens to herself and to her allies, with
a stinging scorn and a force of patriotic indignation which
makes the poet almost forgotten in the citizen. He can banter
Euripides with an ingenuity of light mockery which makes it
seem for the time as if the leading Aristophanic trait was the
art of seeing all things from their prosaic side. Yet it is neither
in the denunciation nor in the mockery that he is most individual.
His truest and highest faculty is revealed by those wonderful
bits of lyric writing in which he soars above everything that can
move laughter or tears, and makes the clear air thrill with the
notes of a song as free, as musical and as wild as that of the
nightingale invoked by his own chorus in the <i>Birds</i>. The speech
of Dikaios Logos in the <i>Clouds</i>, the praises of country life in the
<i>Peace</i>, the serenade in the <i>Ecclesiazusae</i>, the songs of the Spartan
and Athenian maidens in the <i>Lysistrata</i>, above all, perhaps, the
chorus in the <i>Frogs</i>, the beautiful chant of the Initiated,&mdash;these
passages, and such as these, are the true glories of Aristophanes.
They are the strains, not of an artist, but of one who warbles for
pure gladness of heart in some place made bright by the presence
of a god. Nothing else in Greek poetry has quite this wild
sweetness of the woods. Of modern poets Shakespeare alone,
perhaps, has it in combination with a like richness and fertility
of fancy.</p>

<p>Fifty-four<a name="fa2h" id="fa2h" href="#ft2h"><span class="sp">2</span></a> comedies were ascribed to Aristophanes. Forty-three
of these are allowed as genuine by Bergk. Eleven only
are extant. These eleven form a running commentary on the
outer and the inner life of Athens during thirty-six years. They
may be ranged under three periods. The first, extending to
420 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>, includes those plays in which Aristophanes uses an
absolutely unrestrained freedom of political satire. The second
ends with the year 405. Its productions are distinguished from
those of the earlier time by a certain degree of reticence and
caution. The third period, down to 388 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>, comprises two
plays in which the transition to the character of the Middle
Comedy is well marked, not merely by disuse of the parabasis,
but by general self-restraint.</p>

<p>I. <i>First Period</i>, (1) 425 <span class="scs">B.C.</span> <i>The Acharnians</i>.&mdash;Since the
defeat in Boeotia the peace party at Athens had gained ground,
and in this play Aristophanes seeks to strengthen their hands.
Dicaeopolis, an honest countryman, is determined to make
peace with Sparta on his own account, not deterred by the angry
men of Acharnae, who crave vengeance for the devastation of
their vineyards. He sends to Sparta for samples of peace; and
he is so much pleased with the flavour of the Thirty Years&rsquo;
sample that he at once concludes a treaty for himself and his
family. All the blessings of life descend on him; while Lamachus,
the leader of the war party, is smarting from cold, snow and
wounds.</p>

<p>(2) 424 <span class="scs">B.C.</span> <i>The Knights</i>.&mdash;Three years before, in his <i>Babylonians</i>,
Aristophanes had assailed Cleon as the typical demagogue.
In this play he continues the attack. The Demos, or
State, is represented by an old man who has put himself and
his household into the hands of a rascally Paphlagonian steward.
Nicias and Demosthenes, slaves of Demos, contrive that the
Paphlagonian shall be supplanted in their master&rsquo;s favour by
a sausage-seller. No sooner has Demos been thus rescued than
his youthfulness and his good sense return together.</p>

<p>(3) 423 <span class="scs">B.C.</span> <i>The Clouds</i> (the first edition; a second edition
was brought out in 422 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>).&mdash;This play would be correctly
described as an attack on the new spirit of intellectual inquiry
and culture rather than on a school or class. Two classes of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page500" id="page500"></a>500</span>
thinkers or teachers are, however, specially satirized under the
general name of &ldquo;Sophist&rdquo; (v. 331)&mdash;1. The Physical Philosophers&mdash;indicated
by allusions to the doctrines of Anaxagoras,
Heraclitus and Diogenes of Apollonia. 2. The professed
teachers of rhetoric, belles lettres, &amp;c., such as Protagoras and
Prodicus. Socrates is taken as the type of the entire tendency.
A youth named Pheidippides&mdash;obviously meant for Alcibiades&mdash;is
sent by his father to Socrates to be cured of his dissolute
propensities. Under the discipline of Socrates the youth becomes
accomplished in dishonesty and impiety. The conclusion of the
play shows the indignant father preparing to burn up the
philosopher and his hall of contemplation.</p>

<p>(4) 422 <span class="scs">B.C.</span> <i>The Wasps</i>.&mdash;This comedy, which suggested <i>Les
Plaideurs</i> to Racine, is a satire on the Athenian love of litigation.
The strength of demagogy, while it lay chiefly in the ecclesia,
lay partly also in the paid dicasteries. From this point of
view the <i>Wasps</i> may be regarded as supplementing the <i>Knights</i>.
Philocleon (admirer of Cleon), an old man, has a passion for lawsuits&mdash;a
passion which his son, Bdelycleon (detester of Cleon)
fails to check, until he hits upon the device of turning the house
into a law-court, and paying his father for absence from the
public suits. The house-dog steals a Sicilian cheese; the old
man is enabled to gratify his taste by trying the case, and, by an
oversight, acquits the defendant. In the second half of the
play a change comes over the dream of Philocleon; from litigation
he turns to literature and music, and is congratulated
by the chorus on his happy conversion.</p>

<p>(5) 421 <span class="scs">B.C.</span><a name="fa3h" id="fa3h" href="#ft3h"><span class="sp">3</span></a> <i>The Peace</i>.&mdash;In its advocacy of peace with Sparta,
this play, acted at the Great Dionysia shortly before the conclusion
of the treaty, continues the purpose of the <i>Acharnians</i>.
Trygaeus, a distressed Athenian, soars to the sky on a beetle&rsquo;s
back. There he finds the gods engaged in pounding the Greek
states in a mortar. In order to stop this, he frees the goddess
Peace from a well in which she is imprisoned. The pestle and
mortar are laid aside by the gods, and Trygaeus marries one of
the handmaids of Peace.</p>

<p>II. <i>Second Period</i>. (6) 414 <span class="scs">B.C.</span> <i>The Birds</i>.&mdash;Peisthetaerus, an
enterprising Athenian, and his friend Euelpides persuade the
birds to build a city&mdash;&ldquo;Cloud-Cuckoo-borough&rdquo;&mdash;in mid-air,
so as to cut off the gods from men. The plan succeeds; the
gods send envoys to treat with the birds; and Peisthetaerus
marries Basileia, daughter of Zeus. Some have found in the
<i>Birds</i> a complete historical allegory of the Sicilian expedition;
others, a general satire on the prevalence at Athens of headstrong
caprice over law and order; others, merely an aspiration
towards a new and purified Athens&mdash;a dream to which the poet
had turned from his hope for a revival of the Athens of the past.
In another view, the piece is mainly a protest against the religious
fanaticism which the incident of the Hermae had called forth.</p>

<p>(7) 411 <span class="scs">B.C.</span> <i>The Lysistrata</i>.&mdash;This play was brought out during
the earlier stages of those intrigues which led to the revolution
of the Four Hundred. It appeared shortly before Peisander
had arrived in Athens from the camp at Samos for the purpose
of organizing the oligarchic policy. The <i>Lysistrata</i> expresses
the popular desire for peace at any cost. As the men can do
nothing, the women take the question into their own hands,
occupy the citadel, and bring the citizens to surrender.</p>

<p>(8) 411 <span class="scs">B.C.</span> <i>The Thesmophoriazusae</i> (Priestesses of Demeter).&mdash;
This came out three months later than the <i>Lysistrata</i>, during
the reign of terror established by the oligarchic conspirators,
but before their blow had been struck. The political meaning
of the play lies in the absence of political allusion. Fear silences
even comedy. Only women and Euripides are satirized. Euripides
is accused and condemned at the female festival of the
Thesmophoria.</p>

<p>(9) 405 <span class="scs">B.C.</span> <i>The Frogs</i>.&mdash;This piece was brought out just
when Athens had made her last effort in the Peloponnesian War,
eight months before the battle of Aegospotami, and about fifteen
months before the taking of Athens by Lysander. It may be
considered as an attempt to distract men&rsquo;s minds from public
affairs. It is a literary criticism. Aeschylus and Euripides
were both lately dead. Athens is beggared of poets; and Dionysus
goes down to Hades to bring back a poet. Aeschylus and
Euripides contend in the under-world for the throne of tragedy;
and the victory is at last awarded to Aeschylus.</p>

<p>III. <i>Third Period</i>.<a name="fa4h" id="fa4h" href="#ft4h"><span class="sp">4</span></a> (10) 393 <span class="scs">B.C.</span><a href="#ft4h"><span class="sp">4</span></a> <i>The Ecclesiazusae</i> (women
in parliament).&mdash;The women, disguised as men, steal into the
ecclesia, and succeed in decreeing a new constitution. At this
time the demagogue Agyrrhius led the assembly; and the play
is, in fact, a satire on the general demoralization of public life.</p>

<p>(11) 388 <span class="scs">B.C.</span> <i>The Plutus</i> (Wealth).&mdash;The first edition of
the play had appeared in 408 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>, being a symbolical representation
of the fact that the victories won by Alcibiades in the
Hellespont had brought back the god of wealth to the treasure-chamber
of the Parthenon. In its extant form the <i>Plutus</i> is
simply a moral allegory. Chremylus, a worthy but poor man,
falls in with a blind and aged wanderer, who proves to be the god
of wealth. Asclepius restores eyesight to Plutus; whereupon
all the just are made rich and all the unjust are reduced to
poverty.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>Among the lost plays, the following are the chief of which anything
is known:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. <i>The Banqueters</i> <span class="grk" title="Daitaleis">&#916;&#945;&#953;&#964;&#945;&#955;&#949;&#8150;&#962;</span>, 427 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>&mdash;A satire on young
Athens. A father has two sons; one is brought up in the good old
school, another in the tricky subtleties of the new; and the contrast
of results is the chief theme.</p>

<p>2. <i>The Babylonians</i>, 426 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>&mdash;Under this name the subject-allies
of Athens are represented as &ldquo;Babylonians&rdquo;-barbarian slaves,
employed to grind in the mill. The oppression of the allies by the
demagogues&mdash;a topic often touched elsewhere&mdash;was, then, the main
subject of the piece, in which Aristophanes is said to have attacked
especially the system of appointing to offices by lot. The comedy
is memorable as opening that Aristophanic war upon Cleon which
was continued in the <i>Knights</i> and the <i>Wasps</i>.</p>

<p><i>The Merchantmen, The Farmers, The Preliminary Contest</i> (<i>Proagon</i>),
and possibly the <i>Old Age</i> (<i>Geras</i>), belonged to the First Period. The
<i>Geras</i> is assigned by Süvern to 422 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>, and is supposed to have been
a picture of dotage similar to that in the <i>Knights</i>. A comedy called
<i>The Islands</i> is conjectured to have dealt with the sufferings imposed
by the war on the insular tributaries. The <i>Triphales</i> was probably
a satire on Alcibiades; the <i>Storks</i>, on the tragic poet Patrocles.</p>

<p>In the <i>Aeolosicon</i>&mdash;produced by his son Araros in 387 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>&mdash;Aristophanes
probably parodied the <i>Aeolus</i> of Euripides. The
<i>Cocalus</i> is thought to have been a parody of the legend, according
to which a Sicilian king of that name slew Minos.</p>
</div>

<p>A sympathetic reader of Aristophanes can hardly fail to perceive
that, while his political and intellectual tendencies are well
marked, his opinions, in so far as they colour his comedies, are
too indefinite to reward, or indeed to tolerate, analysis. Aristophanes
was a natural conservative. His ideal was the Athens
of the Persian wars. He disapproved the policy which had made
Athenian empire irksome to the allies and formidable to Greece;
he detested the vulgarity and the violence of mob-rule; he clave
to the old worship of the gods; he regarded the new ideas of
education as a tissue of imposture and impiety. How far he
was from clearness or precision of view in regard to the intellectual
revolution which was going forward, appears from the <i>Clouds</i>,
in which thinkers and literary workers who had absolutely
nothing in common are treated with sweeping ridicule as prophets
of a common heresy. Aristophanes is one of the men for whom
opinion is mainly a matter of feeling, not of reason. His imaginative
susceptibility gave him a warm and loyal love for the
traditional glories of Athens, however dim the past to which
they belonged; a horror of what was ugly or ignoble in the
present; a keen perception of what was offensive or absurd in
pretension. The broad preferences and dislikes thus generated
were enough not only to point the moral of comedy, but to make
him, in many cases, a really useful censor for the city. The
service which he could render in this way was, however, only
negative. He could hardly be, in any positive sense, a political
or a moral teacher for Athens. His rooted antipathy to intellectual
progress, while it affords easy and wide scope for his
wit, must after all, lower his intellectual rank. The great minds
are not the enemies of ideas. But as a mocker&mdash;to use the word
which seems most closely to describe him on this side&mdash;he is
incomparable for the union of subtlety with riot of the comic
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page501" id="page501"></a>501</span>
imagination. As a poet, he is immortal. And, among Athenian
poets, he has it for his distinctive characteristic that he is inspired
less by that Greek genius which never allows fancy to escape
from the control of defining, though spiritualizing, reason, than
by such ethereal rapture of the unfettered fancy as lifts Shakespeare
or Shelley above it,&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="bold">ARISTOPHANES,<a name="ar104" id="ar104"></a></span> of Byzantium, Greek critic and grammarian,
was born about 257 <span class="scs">B.C.</span> He removed early to Alexandria, where
he studied under Zenodotus and Callimachus. At the age of
sixty he was appointed chief librarian of the museum. He died
about 185-180 <span class="scs">B.C.</span> Aristophanes chiefly devoted himself to
the poets, especially Homer, who had already been edited by
his master Zenodotus. He also edited Hesiod, the chief lyric,
tragic and comic poets, arranged Plato&rsquo;s dialogues in trilogies,
and abridged Aristotle&rsquo;s <i>Nature of Animals</i>. His arguments
to the plays of Aristophanes and the tragedians are in great part
preserved. His works on Athenian courtesans, masks and
proverbs were the results of his study of Attic comedy. He
further commented on the <span class="grk" title="Pinakes">&#928;&#943;&#957;&#945;&#954;&#949;&#962;</span> of Callimachus, a sort
of history of Greek literature. As a lexicographer, Aristophanes
compiled collections of foreign and unusual words and expressions,
and special lists (words denoting relationship, modes of address).
As a grammarian, he founded a scientific school, and in his
<i>Analogy</i> systematically explained the various forms. He
introduced critical signs&mdash;except the obelus; punctuation
prosodiacal, and accentual marks were probably already in
use. The foundation of the so-called Alexandrian &ldquo;canon&rdquo;
was also due to his impulse (<i>Sandys, Hist. Class. Schol</i>., ed. 1906,

<p><span class="bold">ARISTOTLE<a name="ar105" id="ar105"></a></span> (384-322 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>), the great Greek philosopher, was
born at Stagira, on the Strymonic Gulf, and hence called &ldquo;the
Stagirite.&rdquo; Dionysius of Halicarnassus, in his <i>Epistle on Demosthenes
and Aristotle</i> (chap. 5), gives the following sketch of his
life:&mdash;Aristotle (<span class="grk" title="Aristotelaes">&#902;&#961;&#953;&#963;&#964;&#959;&#964;&#941;&#955;&#951;&#962;</span>) was the son of Nicomachus, who
traced back his descent and his art to Machaon, son of Aesculapius;
his mother being Phaestis, a descendant of one of those who carried
the colony from Chalcis to Stagira. He was born in the 99th
Olympiad in the archonship at Athens of Diotrephes (384-383),
three years before Demosthenes. In the archonship of Polyzelus
(367-366), after the death of his father, in his eighteenth year, he
came to Athens, and having joined Plato spent twenty years with
him. On the death of Plato (May 347) in the archonship of
Theophilus (348-347) he departed to Hermias, tyrant of Atarneus,
and, after three years&rsquo; stay, during the archonship of Eubulus
(345-344) he moved to Mitylene, whence he went to Philip of
Macedon in the archonship of Pythodotus (343-342), and spent
eight years with him as tutor of Alexander. After the death
of Philip (336), in the archonship of Euaenetus (335-334), he
returned to Athens and kept a school in the Lyceum for twelve
years. In the thirteenth, after the death of Alexander (June 323)
in the archonship of Cephisodorus (323-322), having departed to
Chalcis, he died of disease (322), after a life of three-and-sixty
years.</p>

<p class="pt2 center sc">I. Aristotle&rsquo;s Life</p>

<p>This account is practically repeated by Diogenes Laertius in his
<i>Life of Aristotle</i>, on the authority of the <i>Chronicles</i> of Apollodorus,
who lived in the 2nd century <span class="scs">B.C.</span> Starting then from this
tradition, near enough to the time, we can confidently divide
Aristotle&rsquo;s career into four periods: his youth under his parents
till his eighteenth year; his philosophical education under Plato
at Athens till his thirty-eighth year; his travels in the Greek
world till his fiftieth year; and his philosophical teaching in the
Lyceum till his departure to Chalcis and his death in his sixty-third
year. But when we descend from generals to particulars,
we become less certain, and must here content ourselves with
few details.</p>

<p>Aristotle from the first profited by having a father who, being
physician to Amyntas II., king of Macedon, and one of the
Asclepiads who, according to Galen, practised their sons in dissection,
both prepared the way for his son&rsquo;s influence at the
Macedonian court, and gave him a bias to medicine and biology,
which certainly led to his belief in nature and natural science,
and perhaps induced him to practise medicine, as he did, according
to his enemies, Timaeus and Epicurus, when he first went to
Athens. At Athens in his second period for some twenty years he
acquired the further advantage of balancing natural science by
metaphysics and morals in the course of reading Plato&rsquo;s writings
and of hearing Plato&rsquo;s unwritten dogmas (cf. <span class="grk" title="en tois legomenois agraphois dogmasin">&#7952;&#957; &#964;&#959;&#8150;&#962; &#955;&#949;&#947;&#959;&#956;&#941;&#957;&#959;&#953;&#962; &#7936;&#947;&#961;&#940;&#966;&#959;&#953;&#962; &#948;&#972;&#947;&#956;&#945;&#963;&#953;&#957;</span>, Ar. <i>Physics</i>, iv. 2, 209 b 15, Berlin ed.).
He was an earnest, appreciative, independent student. The
master is said to have called his pupil the intellect of the school
and his house a reader&rsquo;s. He is also said to have complained
that his pupil spurned him as colts do their mothers. Aristotle,
however, always revered Plato&rsquo;s memory (<i>Nic. Ethics</i>, i. 6),
and even in criticizing his master counted himself enough of a
Platonist to cite Plato&rsquo;s doctrines as what &ldquo;we say&rdquo; (cf. <span class="grk" title="phamen">&#966;&#945;&#956;&#941;&#957;</span>,
<i>Metaphysics</i>, i. 9, 990 b 16). At the same time, he must have
learnt much from other contemporaries at Athens, especially from
astronomers such as Eudoxus and Callippus, and from orators
such as Isocrates and Demosthenes. He also attacked Isocrates,
according to Cicero, and perhaps even set up a rival school of
rhetoric. At any rate he had pupils of his own, such as Eudemus
of Cyprus, Theodectes and Hermias, books of his own, especially
dialogues, and even to some extent his own philosophy, while he
was still a pupil of Plato.</p>

<p>Well grounded in his boyhood, and thoroughly educated in his
manhood, Aristotle, after Plato&rsquo;s death, had the further advantage
of travel in his third period, when he was in his prime. The
appointment of Plato&rsquo;s nephew, Speusippus, to succeed his uncle
in the Academy induced Aristotle and Xenocrates to leave
Athens together and repair to the court of Hermias. Aristotle
admired Hermias, and married his friend&rsquo;s sister or niece, Pythias,
by whom he had his daughter Pythias. After the tragic death of
Hermias, he retired for a time to Mitylene, and in 343-342 was
summoned to Macedon by Philip to teach Alexander, who was
then a boy of thirteen. According to Cicero (<i>De Oratore</i>, iii. 41),
Philip wished his son, then a boy of thirteen, to receive from
Aristotle &ldquo;agendi praecepta et eloquendi.&rdquo; Aristotle is said to
have written on monarchy and on colonies for Alexander; and
the pupil is said to have slept with his master&rsquo;s edition of Homer
under his pillow, and to have respected him, until from hatred of
Aristotle&rsquo;s tactless relative, Callisthenes, who was done to death
in 328, he turned at last against Aristotle himself. Aristotle
had power to teach, and Alexander to learn. Still we must not
exaggerate the result. Dionysius must have spoken too strongly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page502" id="page502"></a>502</span>
when he says that Aristotle was tutor of Alexander for eight
years; for in 340, when Philip went to war with Byzantium,
Alexander became regent at home, at the age of sixteen. From
this date Aristotle probably spent much time at his paternal house
in his native city at Stagira as a patriotic citizen. Philip had
sacked it in 348: Aristotle induced him or his son to restore it,
made for it a new constitution, and in return was celebrated in
a festival after his death. All these vicissitudes made him a man
of the world, drew him out of the philosophical circle at Athens,
and gave him leisure to develop his philosophy. Besides
Alexander he had other pupils: Callisthenes, Cassander, Marsyas,
Phanias, and Theophrastus of Eresus, who is said to have had
land at Stagira. He also continued the writings begun in his
second period; and the Macedonian kings have the glory of
having assisted the Stagirite philosopher with the means of
conducting his researches in the <i>History of Animals</i>.</p>

<p>At last, in his fourth period, after the accession of Alexander,
Aristotle at fifty returned to Athens and became the head of
his own school in the Lyceum, a gymnasium near the temple of
Apollo Lyceius in the suburbs. The master and his scholars were
called Peripatetics (<span class="grk" title="oi ek ton peripaton">&#959;&#7985; &#7952;&#954; &#964;&#959;&#8166; &#960;&#949;&#961;&#953;&#960;&#940;&#964;&#959;&#965;</span>), certainly from meeting,
like other philosophical schools, in a walk (<span class="grk" title="peripatos">&#960;&#949;&#961;&#943;&#960;&#945;&#964;&#959;&#962;</span>), and
perhaps also, on the authority of Hermippus of Smyrna, from
walking and talking there, like Protagoras and his followers as
described in Plato&rsquo;s <i>Protagoras</i> (314 <span class="scs">E</span>, 315 <span class="scs">C</span>). Indeed, according
to Ammonius, Plato too had talked as he walked in the Academy;
and all his followers were called Peripatetics, until, while the
pupils of Xenocrates took the name &ldquo;Academics,&rdquo; those of
Aristotle retained the general name. Aristotle also formed his
Peripatetic school into a kind of college with common meals
under a president (<span class="grk" title="archon">&#7940;&#961;&#967;&#969;&#957;</span>) changing every ten days; while the
philosopher himself delivered lectures, in which his practice, as his
pupil Aristoxenus tells us (<i>Harmonics</i> ii, <i>init</i>.), was, avoiding the
generalities of Plato, to prepare his audience by explaining the
subject of investigation and its nature. But Aristotle was an
author as well as a lecturer; for the hypothesis that the Aristotelian
writings are notes of his lectures taken down by his pupils
is contradicted by the tradition of their learning while walking,
and disproved by the impossibility of taking down such complicated
discourses from dictation. Moreover, it is clear that
Aristotle addressed himself to readers as well as hearers, as in
concluding his whole theory of syllogisms he says, &ldquo;There would
remain for all of you or for our hearers (<span class="grk" title="panton umon ae ton aekroamenon">&#960;&#940;&#957;&#964;&#969;&#957; &#8017;&#956;&#8182;&#957; &#7970; &#964;&#8182;&#957;</span>) a duty of according to the defects of the investigation
consideration, to its discoveries much gratitude&rdquo; (<i>Sophisticai
Elenchi</i>, 34,184 b 6). In short, Aristotle was at once a student,
a reader, a lecturer, a writer and a book collector. He was, says
Strabo (608), the first we knew who collected books and taught
the kings in Egypt the arrangement of a library. In his library
no doubt were books of others, but also his own. There we must
figure to ourselves the philosopher, constantly referring to his
autograph rolls; entering references and cross-references; correcting,
rewriting, collecting and arranging them according to
their subjects; showing as well as reading them to his pupils;
with little thought of publication, but with his whole soul concentrated
on being and truth.</p>

<p>On his first visit to Athens, during which occurred the fatal
battle of Mantineia (362 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>), Aristotle had seen the confusion of
Greece becoming the opportunity of Macedon under Philip; and
on his second visit he was supported at Athens by the complete
domination of Macedon under Alexander. Having witnessed the
unjust exactions of a democracy at Athens, the dwindling
population of an oligarchy at Sparta, and the oppressive selfishness
of new tyrannies throughout the Greek world, he condemned
the actual constitutions of the Greek states as deviations (<span class="grk" title="parekbaseis">&#960;&#945;&#961;&#949;&#954;&#946;&#940;&#963;&#949;&#953;&#962;</span>)
directed merely to the good of the government; and
he contemplated a right constitution (<span class="grk" title="orthae politeia">&#8000;&#961;&#952;&#8052; &#960;&#959;&#955;&#953;&#964;&#949;&#943;&#945;</span>), which
might be either a commonwealth, an aristocracy or a monarchy,
directed to the general good; but he preferred the monarchy of
one man, pre-eminent in virtue above the rest, as the best of all
governments (<i>Nicomachean Ethics</i>, viii. 10; <i>Politics</i>, &Gamma; 14-18).
Moreover, by adding (<i>Politics</i>, &Eta; 7, 1327 b 29-33) that the Greek
race could govern the world by obtaining one constitution (<span class="grk" title="mias tonchanon politeias">&#956;&#953;&#8118;&#962; &#964;&#965;&#947;&#967;&#940;&#957;&#959;&#957; &#960;&#959;&#955;&#953;&#964;&#949;&#943;&#945;&#962;</span>),
he indicated some leaning to a universal
monarchy under such a king as Alexander. On the whole,
however, he adhered to the Greek city-state (<span class="grk" title="polis">&#960;&#972;&#955;&#953;&#962;</span>), partly
perhaps out of patriotism to his own Stagira. Averse at all
events to the Athenian democracy, leaning towards Macedonian
monarchy, and resting on Macedonian power, he maintained
himself in his school at Athens, so long as he was supported by the
friendship of Antipater, the Macedonian regent in Alexander&rsquo;s
absence. But on Alexander&rsquo;s sudden death in 323, when Athens
in the Lamian war tried to reassert her freedom against Antipater,
Aristotle found himself in danger. He was accused of impiety
on the absurd charge of deifying the tyrant Hermias; and,
remembering the fate of Socrates, he retired to Chalcis in Euboea.
There, away from his school, in 322 he died. (A tomb has been
found in our time inscribed with the name of Biote, daughter of
Aristotle. But is this <i>our</i> Aristotle?)</p>

<p>Such is our scanty knowledge of Aristotle&rsquo;s life, which seems
to have been prosperous by inheritance and position, and happy
by work and philosophy. His will, which was quoted by Hermippus,
and, as afterwards quoted by Diogenes Laertius, has
come down to us, though perhaps not complete, supplies some
further details, as follows:&mdash;Antipater is to be executor with
others. Nicanor is to marry Pythias, Aristotle&rsquo;s daughter, and
to take charge of Nicomachus his son. Theophrastus is to be one
of the executors if he will and can, and if Nicanor should die to
act instead, if he will, in reference to Pythias. The executors and
Nicanor are to take charge of Herpyllis, &ldquo;because,&rdquo; in the words
of the testator, &ldquo;she has been good to me,&rdquo; and to allow her to
reside either in the lodging by the garden at Chalcis or in the
paternal house at Stagira. They are to provide for the slaves,
who in some cases are to be freed. They are to see after the
dedication of four images by Gryllion of Nicanor, Proxenus,
Nicanor&rsquo;s mother and Arimnestus. They are to dedicate an
image of Aristotle&rsquo;s mother, and to see that the bones of his wife
Pythias are, as she ordered, taken up and buried with him. On
this will we may remark that Proxenus is said to have been
Aristotle&rsquo;s guardian after the death of his father, and to have
been the father of Nicanor; that Herpyllis of Stagira was the
mother of Nicomachus by Aristotle; and that Arimnestus was
the brother of Aristotle, who also had a sister, Arimneste. Every
clause breathes the philosopher&rsquo;s humanity.</p>

<p class="pt2 center sc">II. Development from Platonism</p>

<p>Turning now from the man to the philosopher as we know him
best in his extant writings (see <i>Aristoteles</i>, ed. Bekker, Berlin,
1831, the pages of which we use for our quotations), we find,
instead of the general dialogues of Plato, special didactic treatises,
and a fundamental difference of philosophy, so great as to have
divided philosophers into opposite camps, and made Coleridge
say that everybody is born either a Platonist or an Aristotelian.
Platonism is the doctrine that the individuals we call things only
become, but a thing is always one universal form beyond many
individuals, <i>e.g.</i> one good beyond seeming goods; and that
without supernatural forms, which are models of individuals,
there is nothing, no being, no knowing, no good. Aristotelianism
is the contrary doctrine: a thing is always a separate individual,
a <i>substance</i> (<span class="grk" title="ousia">&#959;&#8016;&#963;&#943;&#945;</span>), natural such as earth or supernatural such
as God; and without these individual substances, which have
attributes and universals belonging to them, there is nothing, to
be, to know, to be good. Philosophic differences are best felt by
their practical effects: philosophically, Platonism is a philosophy
of universal forms, Aristotelianism a philosophy of individual
substances: practically, Plato makes us think first of the supernatural
and the kingdom of heaven, Aristotle of the natural and
the whole world.</p>

<p>So diametrical a difference could not have arisen at once.
For, though Aristotle was different from Plato, and brought with
him from Stagira a Greek and Ionic but colonial origin, a medical
descent and tendency, and a matter-of-fact worldly kind of
character, nevertheless on coming to Athens as pupil of Plato he
must have begun with his master&rsquo;s philosophy. What then in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page503" id="page503"></a>503</span>
more detail was the philosophy which the pupil learnt from the
master? When Aristotle at the age of eighteen came to Athens,
Plato, at the age of sixty-two, had probably written all his
dialogues except the <i>Laws</i>; and in the course of the remaining
twenty years of his life and teaching, he expounded &ldquo;the so-called
unwritten dogmas&rdquo; in his lectures on the Good. There
was therefore a written Platonism for Aristotle to read, and an
unwritten Platonism which he actually heard.</p>

<p>To begin with the written philosophy of the Dialogues.
Individual so-called things neither are nor are not, but become:
the real thing is always one universal form beyond the many individuals,
<i>e.g.</i> the one beautiful beyond all beautiful individuals;
and each form (<span class="grk" title="idea">&#7984;&#948;&#941;&#945;</span>) is a model which causes individuals by participation
to become like, but not the same as, itself. Above
all forms stands the form of the good, which is the cause of all
other forms being, and through them of all individuals becoming.
The creator, or the divine intellect, with a view to the form of the
good, and taking all forms as models, creates in a receptacle
(<span class="grk" title="hypodochae">&#8017;&#960;&#959;&#948;&#959;&#967;&#942;</span>, Plato, <i>Timaeus</i>, 49 <span class="scs">A</span>) individual impressions which
are called things but really change and become without attaining
the permanence of being. Knowledge resides not in sense but
in reason, which, on the suggestion of sensations of changing
individuals, apprehends, or (to be precise) is reminded of, real
universal forms, and, by first ascending from less to more general
until it arrives at the form of good and then descending from this
unconditional principle to the less general, becomes science and
philosophy, using as its method the dialectic which gives and
receives questions and answers between man and man. Happiness
in this world consists proximately in virtue as a harmony
between the three parts, rational, spirited and appetitive, of our
souls, and ultimately in living according to the form of the good;
but there is a far higher happiness, when the immortal soul,
divesting itself of body and passions and senses, rises from earth
to heaven and contemplates pure forms by pure reason. Such
in brief is the Platonism of the written dialogues; where the
main doctrine of forms is confessedly advanced never as a dogma
but always as a hypothesis, in which there are difficulties, but
without which Plato can explain neither being, nor truth nor
goodness, because throughout he denies the being of individual
things. In the unwritten lectures of his old age, he developed
this formal into a mathematical metaphysics. In order to
explain the unity and variety of the world, the one universal form
and the many individuals, and how the one good is the main
cause of everything, he placed as it were at the back of his own
doctrine of forms a Pythagorean mathematical philosophy. He
supposed that the one and the two, which is indeterminate, and is
the great and little, are opposite principles or causes. Identifying
the form of the good with the one, he supposed that the one, by
combining with the indeterminate two, causes a plurality of forms,
which like every combination of one and two are numbers but
peculiar in being incommensurate with one another, so that each
form is not a mathematical number (<span class="grk" title="mathaematikos arithmos">&#956;&#945;&#952;&#951;&#956;&#945;&#964;&#953;&#954;&#8056;&#962; &#7936;&#961;&#953;&#952;&#956;&#972;&#962;</span>),
but a formal number (<span class="grk" title="eidaetikos arithmos">&#949;&#7984;&#948;&#951;&#964;&#953;&#954;&#8056;&#962; &#7936;&#961;&#953;&#952;&#956;&#972;&#962;</span>). Further he supposed
that in its turn each form, or formal number, is a limited
one which, by combining again with the indeterminate two,
causes a plurality of individuals. Hence finally he concluded
that the good as the one combining with the indeterminate
two is directly the cause of all forms as formal numbers, and
indirectly through them all of the multitude of individuals in
the world.</p>

<p>Aristotle knew Plato, was present at his lectures on the Good,
wrote a report of them (<span class="grk" title="peri tagathou">&#960;&#949;&#961;&#8054; &#964;&#7936;&#947;&#945;&#952;&#959;&#8166;</span>), and described this latter
philosophy of Plato in his <i>Metaphysics</i>. Modern critics, who
were not present and knew neither, often accuse Aristotle of misrepresenting
Plato. But Heracleides and Hestiacus, Speusippus
and Xenocrates were also present and wrote similar reports.
What is more, both Speusippus and Xenocrates founded their
own philosophies on this very Pythagoreanism of Plato. Speusippus
as president of the Academy from 347 to 339 taught that
the one and the many are principles, while abolishing forms and
reducing the good from cause to effect. Xenocrates as president
from 339 onwards taught that the one and many are principles,
only without distinguishing mathematical from formal numbers.
Aristotle&rsquo;s critics hardly realize that for the rest of his life he
had to live and to struggle with a formal and a mathematical
Platonism, which exaggerated first universals and attributes
and afterwards the quantitative attributes, one and many, into
substantial things and real causes.</p>

<p>Aristotle had no sympathy with the unwritten dogmas of
Plato. But with the written dialogues of Plato he always
continued to agree almost as much as he disagreed. Like Plato,
he believed in real universals, real essences, real causes; he
believed in the unity of the universal, and in the immateriality
of essences; he believed in the good, and that there is a good of
the universe; he believed that God is a living being, eternal and
best, who is a supernatural cause of the motions and changes of
the natural world, and that essences and matter are also necessary
causes; he believed in the divine intelligence and in the immortality
of our intelligent souls; he believed in knowledge going
from sense to reason, that science requires ascent to principles
and is descent from principles, and that dialectic is useful to
science; he believed in happiness involving virtue, and in moral
virtue being a control of passions by reason, while the highest
happiness is speculative wisdom. All these inspiring metaphysical
and moral doctrines the pupil accepted from his master&rsquo;s
dialogues, and throughout his life adhered to the general spirit of
realism without materialism pervading the Platonic philosophy.
But what he refused to believe with Plato was that reality is not
here, but only above; and what he maintained against Plato was
that it is both, and that universals and forms, one and many, the
good, are real but not separate realities. This deep metaphysical
divergence was the prime cause of the transition from Platonism
to Aristotelianism.</p>

<p><i>Fragmenta Aristotelis.</i>&mdash;Aristotle&rsquo;s originality soon asserted
itself in early writings, of which fragments have come down to
us, and have been collected by Rose (see the Berlin edition of
Aristotle&rsquo;s works, or more readily in the Teubner series, which
we shall use for our quotations). Many, no doubt, are spurious;
but some are genuine, and a few perhaps cited in Aristotle&rsquo;s
extant works. Some are dialogues, others didactic works. A
special interest attaches to the dialogues written after the manner
of Plato but with Aristotle as principal interlocutor; and some
of these, <i>e.g.</i> the <span class="grk" title="peri poiaeton">&#960;&#949;&#961;&#8054; &#960;&#959;&#953;&#951;&#964;&#8182;&#957;</span> and the <i>Eudemus</i>, seem to have
been published. It is not always certain which were dialogues,
which didactic like Aristotle&rsquo;s later works; but by comparing
those which were certainly dialogues with their companions in
the list of Aristotle&rsquo;s books as given by Diogenes Laertius, we
may conclude with Bernays that the books occurring first in that
list were dialogues. Hence we may perhaps accept as genuine

</div>

<p>Difficult as it is to determine when Aristotle wrote all these
various works, some of them indicate their dates. Gryllus,
celebrated in the dialogue on rhetoric, was Xenophon&rsquo;s son
who fell at Mantineia in 362; and Eudemus of Cyprus, lamented
in the dialogue on soul, died in Sicily in 352. These then were
probably written before Plato died in 347; and so probably were
most of the dialogues, precisely because they were imitations of
the dialogues of Plato. Among the didactic writings, the <span class="grk" title="peri tagathou">&#960;&#949;&#961;&#8054; &#964;&#8048;&#947;&#945;&#952;&#959;&#8166;</span>
would probably belong to the same time, because it was
Aristotle&rsquo;s report of Plato&rsquo;s lectures. On the other hand, the
two political works, if written for Alexander, would be after
343-342 when Philip made Aristotle his tutor. So probably
were the rhetorical works, especially the <i>Theodectea</i>; since both
politics and oratory were the subjects which the father wanted
the tutor to teach his son, and, when Alexander came to Phaselis,
he is said by Plutarch (<i>Alexander</i>, 17) to have decorated the
statue of Theodectes in honour of his association with the man
through Aristotle and philosophy. On the whole, then, it seems
as if Aristotle began with dialogues during his second period
under Plato, but gradually came to prefer writing didactic
works, especially in the third period after Plato&rsquo;s death, and
in connexion with Alexander.</p>

<p>These early writings show clearly how Aristotle came to depart
from Plato. In the first place as regards style, though the
Stagirite pupil Aristotle could never rival his Attic master in
literary form, yet he did a signal service to philosophy in
gradually passing from the vague generalities of the dialogue to
the scientific precision of the didactic treatise. The philosophy
of Plato is dialogue trying to become science; that of Aristotle
science retaining traces of dialectic. Secondly as regards subject-matter,
even in his early writings Aristotle tends to widen the
scope of philosophic inquiry, so as not only to embrace metaphysics
and politics, but also to encourage rhetoric and poetics,
which Plato tended to discourage or limit. Thirdly as regards doctrines,
the surpassing interest of these early writings is that they
show the pupil partly agreeing, partly disagreeing, with his master.
The <i>Eudemus</i> and <i>Protrepticus</i> are with Plato; the dialogues
<i>on Philosophy</i> and the treatise <i>on Forms</i> are against Plato.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>The <i>Eudemus</i>, on the soul (<i>Fragmenta</i>, 37 seq.), must have been in
style and thought the most Platonic of all the Aristotelian writings.
Plato&rsquo;s theory of the soul and its immortality was not the ordinary
Greek view derived from Homer, who regarded the body as the self,
the soul as a shade having a future state but an obscure existence,
and stamped that view on the hearts of his countrymen, and affected
Aristotle himself. After Homer there had come to Greece the new
view that the soul is more real than the body, that it is imprisoned in
the carcase as a prison-house, that it is capable of enjoying a happier
life freed from the body, and that it can transmigrate from body to
body. This strange, exotic, ascetic view was adopted by some
philosophers, and especially by the Pythagoreans, and so transmitted
to Plato. Aristotle in the <i>Eudemus</i>, written about 352, when he was
thirty-two, also believed in it. Accordingly, the soul of Eudemus,
when it left his body, is said to be returning home: the soul is made
subject to the casting of lots, and in coming from the other world to
this it is supposed to forget its former visions: but its disembodied
life is regarded as its natural life in a better world. The <i>Eudemus</i>
also contained a celebrated passage, preserved by Plutarch (<i>Consolat.
ad Apoll.</i>.27; <i>Fragm.</i> 44). Here we can read the young Aristotle,
writing in the form of the dialogue like Plato, avoiding hiatus like
Isocrates, and justifying the praises accorded to his style by Cicero,
Quintilian and Dionysius. It shows how nearly the pupil could
imitate his master&rsquo;s dialogues, and still more how exactly he at first
embraced his master&rsquo;s doctrines. It makes Silenus, captured by
Midas, say that the best of all things is not to have been born, and
the next best, having been born, to die as soon as possible. Nothing
could be more like Plato&rsquo;s <i>Phaedo</i>, or more unlike Aristotle&rsquo;s later
work <i>on the Soul</i>, which entirely rejects transmigration and allows
the next life to sink into the background.</p>

<p>Hardly less Platonic is the <i>Protrepticus</i> (<i>Fragm.</i> 50 seq.), an
exhortation to philosophy which, according to Zeno the Stoic, was
studied by his master Crates. It is an exhortation, whose point is
that the chief good is philosophy, the contemplation of the universe
by divine and immortal intellect. This is indeed a doctrine of
Platonic ethics from which Aristotle in his later days never swerved.
But in the <i>Protrepticus</i> he goes on to say that seeming goods, such
as strength, size, beauty, honours, opinions, are mere illusion
(<span class="grk" title="okiagraphia">&#963;&#954;&#953;&#945;&#947;&#961;&#945;&#966;&#943;&#945;</span>), worthless and ridiculous, as we should know if we
had Lyncean eyes to compare them with the vision of the eternal.
This indifference to goods of body and estate is quite Platonic, but is
very different from Aristotle&rsquo;s later ethical doctrine that such goods,
though not the essence, are nevertheless necessary conditions of
happiness. Finally, in the spirit of Plato&rsquo;s <i>Phaedo</i> and the dialogue
<i>Eudemus</i>, the <i>Protrepticus</i> holds that the soul is bound to the sentient
members of the body as prisoners in Etruria are bound face to face
with corpses; whereas the later view of the <i>De Anima</i> is that the soul
is the vital principle of the body and the body the necessary organ of
the soul.</p>

<p>Thus we find that at first, under the influence of his master,
Aristotle held somewhat ascetic views on soul and body and on goods
of body and estate, entirely opposed both in psychology and in ethics
to the moderate doctrines of his later writings. This perhaps is one
reason why Cicero, who had Aristotle&rsquo;s early writings, saw no difference
between the Academy and the Peripatetics (<i>Acad. Post</i>, i. 4,
17-18).</p>

<p>On the other hand, the dialogue <i>on Philosophy</i> (<span class="grk" title="peri philosophias">&#960;&#949;&#961;&#8054; &#966;&#953;&#955;&#959;&#963;&#959;&#966;&#943;&#945;&#962;</span>,
<i>Fragm.</i> 1 seq.) strikingly exhibits the origin of Aristotle&rsquo;s divergence
from Platonism, and that too in Plato&rsquo;s lifetime. The young son
of a doctor from the colonies proved too fond of this world to
stomach his Athenian master&rsquo;s philosophy of the supernatural.
Accordingly in this dialogue he attacked Plato&rsquo;s fundamental
position, both in its written and in its unwritten presentment, as a
hypothesis both of forms and of formal numbers. First, he attacked
the hypothesis of forms (<span class="grk" title="taen ton ideon hypothesin">&#964;&#8052;&#957; &#964;&#8182;&#957; &#7984;&#948;&#949;&#8182;&#957; &#8017;&#960;&#972;&#952;&#949;&#963;&#953;&#957;</span>, <i>Fragm.</i> 8), exclaiming
in his dialogues, according to Proclus, that he could not sympathize
with the dogma even if it should be thought that he was opposing
it out of contentiousness; while Plutarch says that his attacks on
the forms by means of his exoteric dialogues were thought by some
persons more contentious than philosophical, as presuming to disdain
Plato&rsquo;s philosophy: so far was he, says Plutarch, from following it.
Secondly, in the same dialogue (<i>Fragm.</i> 9), according to Syrianus,
he disagreed with the hypothesis of formal numbers (<span class="grk" title="tois eidaetikois
arithmois">&#964;&#959;&#8150;&#962; &#949;&#7984;&#948;&#951;&#964;&#953;&#954;&#959;&#8150;&#962; &#7936;&#961;&#953;&#952;&#956;&#959;&#8150;&#962;</span>). If, wrote Aristotle, the forms are another sort of
number, not mathematical, there would be no understanding of it.
Lastly, in the same dialogue (<i>Fragm.</i> 18 seq.) he revealed his
emphasis on nature by contending that the universe is uncreate and
indestructible. According to Plato, God caused the natural world to
become: according to Aristotle it is eternal. This eternity of the
world became one of his characteristic doctrines, and subsequently
enabled him to explain how essences can be eternal without being
separate from this world which is also eternal (cf. <i>Metaph.</i> &Zeta; 8).
Thus early did Aristotle begin, even in Plato&rsquo;s lifetime, to oppose
Plato&rsquo;s hypothesis of supernatural forms, and advance his own
hypothesis of the eternity of the world.</p>

<p>He made another attack on Platonism in the didactic work <span class="grk" title="peri ideon">&#960;&#949;&#961;&#8054; &#7984;&#948;&#949;&#8182;&#957;</span>, (<i>Fragm.</i> 185 seq.), contending that the Platonic arguments
prove not forms (<span class="grk" title="ideai">&#7984;&#948;&#941;&#945;&#953;</span>) but only things common (<span class="grk" title="ta koina">&#964;&#8048; &#954;&#963;&#953;&#957;&#940;</span>).
Here, according to Alexander the commentator, he first brought
against Plato the argument of &ldquo;the third man&rdquo; (<span class="grk" title="ho tritos anthropos">&#8056; &#964;&#961;&#943;&#964;&#959;&#962; &#7940;&#957;&#952;&#961;&#969;&#960;&#959;&#962;</span>);
that, if there is the form, one man beyond many men, there will be
a third man predicated of both man and men, and a fourth predicated
of all three, and so on to infinity (<i>Fragm.</i> 188). Here, too, he
examined the hypothesis of Eudoxus that things are caused by
mixture of forms, a hypothesis which formed a kind of transition to
his own later views, but failed to satisfy him on account of its difficulties.
Lastly, in the didactic work <span class="grk" title="peri tagathou">&#960;&#949;&#961;&#8054; &#964;&#7936;&#947;&#945;&#952;&#959;&#8166;</span> (<i>Fragm.</i> 27 seq.),
containing his report of Plato&rsquo;s lectures on the Good, he was dealing
with the same mathematical metaphysics which in his dialogue <i>on
Philosophy</i> he criticized for converting forms into formal numbers.
Aristoxenus, at the beginning of the second book of the <i>Harmonics</i>,
gives a graphic account of the astonishment caused by these lectures
of Plato, and of their effect on the lectures of Aristotle. In contending,
as Aristotle&rsquo;s pupil, that a teacher should begin by proposing his
subject, he tells us how Aristotle used to relate that most of Plato&rsquo;s
hearers came expecting to get something about human goods and
happiness, but that when the discourses turned out to be all about
mathematics, with the conclusion that good is one, it appeared to
them a paradox, which some despised and others condemned. The
reason, he adds, was that they were not informed by Plato beforehand;
and for this very reason, Aristotle, as he told Aristoxenus
himself, used to prepare his hearers by informing them of the nature
of the subject. From this rare personal reminiscence we see at a
glance that the mind of Plato and the mind of Aristotle were so
different, that their philosophies must diverge; the one towards the
supernatural, the abstract, the discursive, and the other towards the
natural, the substantial, the scientific.</p>

<p>Aristotle then even in the second period of his life, while Plato
was still alive, began to differ from him in metaphysics. He rejected
the Platonic hypothesis of forms, and affirmed that they are not
separate but common, without however as yet having advanced to a
constructive metaphysics of his own; while at the same time, after
having at first adopted his master&rsquo;s dialectical treatment of metaphysical
problems, he soon passed from dialogues to didactic works,
which had the result of separating metaphysics from dialectic. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page505" id="page505"></a>505</span>
all-important consequence of this first departure from Platonism
was that Aristotle became and remained primarily a metaphysician.
After Plato&rsquo;s death, coming to his third period he made a further
departure from Platonism in his didactic works on politics and
rhetoric, written in connexion with Alexander and Theodectes. Those
on politics (<i>Fragm.</i> 646-648) were designed to instruct Alexander
on monarchy and on colonization; and in them Aristotle agreed
with Plato in assigning a moral object to the state, but departed from
him by saying that a king need not be a philosopher, as Plato had
said in the <i>Republic</i>, but does need to listen to philosophers. Still
more marked was his departure from Plato as regards rhetoric.
Plato in the <i>Gorgias</i>, (501 <span class="scs">A</span>) had contended that rhetoric is not an
art but an empirical practice (<span class="grk" title="tribae kai empeiria">&#964;&#961;&#953;&#946;&#8052; &#954;&#945;&#8054; &#7952;&#956;&#960;&#949;&#953;&#961;&#943;&#945;</span>); Aristotle in the
<i>Gryllus</i> (<i>Fragm.</i> 68-69), written in his second period, took according
to Quintilian a similar view. But in his third period, in the
<i>Theodectea</i> (<i>Fragm.</i> 125 seq.), rhetoric is treated as an art, and is
laid out somewhat in the manner of his later <i>Art of Rhetoric</i>; while
he also showed his interest in the subject by writing a history of
other arts of rhetoric called <span class="grk" title="technon ounagogae">&#964;&#949;&#967;&#957;&#8182;&#957; &#963;&#965;&#957;&#945;&#947;&#969;&#947;&#942;</span> (<i>Fragm.</i> 136 seq.).
Further, in treating rhetoric as an art in the <i>Theodectea</i> he was forced
into a conclusion, which carried him far beyond Plato&rsquo;s rigid notions
of proof and of passion: he concluded that it is the work of an orator
to use persuasion, and to arouse the passions (<span class="grk" title="to ta pathae diageirai">&#964;&#8056; &#964;&#8048; &#960;&#940;&#952;&#951; &#948;&#953;&#945;&#947;&#949;&#8150;&#961;&#945;&#953;</span>),
<i>e.g.</i> anger and pity (<i>ib.</i> 133-134). Nor could he treat poetry as he is
said to have done without the same result.</p>
</div>

<p>On the whole then, in his early dialectical and didactic writings,
of which mere fragments remain, Aristotle had already diverged
from Plato, and first of all in metaphysics. During his master&rsquo;s
life, in the second period of his own life, he protested against
the Platonic hypothesis of forms, formal numbers and the
one as the good, and tended to separate metaphysics from
dialectic by beginning to pass from dialogues to didactic works.
After his master&rsquo;s death, in the third period of his own life, and
during his connexion with Alexander, but before the final construction
of his philosophy into a system, he was tending to write
more and more in the didactic style; to separate from dialectic,
not only metaphysics, but also politics, rhetoric and poetry; to
admit by the side of philosophy the arts of persuasive language;
to think it part of their legitimate work to rouse the passions; and
in all these ways to depart from the ascetic rigidity of the philosophy
of Plato, so as to prepare for the tolerant spirit of his own,
and especially for his ethical doctrine that virtue consists not in
suppressing but in moderating almost all human passions. In
both periods, too, as we shall find in the sequel, he was already
occupied in composing some of the extant writings which were
afterwards to form parts of his final philosophical system. But
as yet he had given no sign of system, and&mdash;what is surprising&mdash;no
trace of logic. Aristotle was primarily a metaphysician
against Plato; a metaphysician before he was a logician; a
metaphysician who made what he called primary philosophy

<p class="pt2 center sc">III. Composition of his Extant Works</p>

<p>The system which was taught by Aristotle at Athens in the
fourth period of his life, and which is now known as the Aristotelian
philosophy, is contained not in fragments but in extant
books. It will be best then to give at once a list of these extant
works, following the traditional order in which they have long
been arranged, and marking with a dagger (&dagger;) those which are
now usually considered not to be genuine, though not always
with sufficient reason.</p>

<span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Constitution of Athens</a></span>.)</p>
</div>

<p><i>The Difficulty</i>.&mdash;The genuineness of the Aristotelian works, as
Leibnitz truly said (<i>De Stilo Phil. Nizolii</i>, xxx.), is ascertained
by the conspicuous harmony of their theories, and by their
uniform method of swift subtlety. Nevertheless difficulties lurk
beneath their general unity of thought and style. In style they
are not quite the same: now they are brief and now diffuse:
sometimes they are carelessly written, sometimes so carefully as
to avoid hiatus, <i>e.g.</i> the <i>Metaphysics</i> &Alpha;, and parts of the <i>De
Coelo</i> and <i>Parva Naturalia</i>, which in this respect resemble the
fragment quoted by Plutarch from the early dialogue <i>Eudemus</i>
(<i>Fragm</i>. 44). They also appear to contain displacements,
interpolations, prefaces such as that to the <i>Meteorologica</i>, and
appendices such as that to the <i>Sophistical Elenchi</i>, which may
have been added. An Aristotelian work often goes on continuously
at first, and then becomes disappointing by suddenly
introducing discussions which break the connexion or are even
inconsistent with the beginning; as in the <i>Posterior Analytics</i>,
which, after developing a theory of demonstration from necessary
principles, suddenly makes the admission, which is also the main
theory of science in the <i>Metaphysics</i>, that demonstration is about
either the necessary or the contingent, from principles either
necessary or contingent, only not accidental. At times order is
followed by disorder, as in the <i>Politics</i>. Again, there are repetitions
and double versions, <i>e.g.</i> those of the <i>Physics</i>, vii.,
and those of the <i>De Anima</i>, ii., discovered by Torstrik; or two
discussions of the same subject, <i>e.g.</i> of pleasure in the <i>Nicomachean
Ethics</i>, vii. and x.; or several treatises on the same
subject very like one another, viz. the <i>Nicomachean Ethics</i>, the
<i>Eudemian Ethics</i> and the <i>Magna Moralia</i>; or, strangest of all,
a consecutive treatise and other discourses amalgamated, <i>e.g.</i> in
the <i>Metaphysics</i>, where a systematic theory of being running
through several books (&Beta;, &Gamma;, &Epsilon;, &Zeta;, &Eta;, &Theta;) is preceded, interrupted
and followed by other discussions of the subject. Further, there
are frequently several titles of the same work or of different
parts of it. Sometimes diagrams (<span class="grk" title="diagraphai">&#948;&#953;&#945;&#947;&#961;&#945;&#966;&#945;&#943;</span> or <span class="grk" title="hypographai">&#8017;&#960;&#959;&#947;&#961;&#945;&#966;&#945;&#943;</span>) are
mentioned, and sometimes given (<i>e.g.</i> in <i>De Interp</i>. 13, 22 a 22;
<i>Nicomachean Ethics</i>, ii. 7; <i>Eudemian Ethics</i>, ii. 3), but sometimes
only implied (<i>e.g.</i> in <i>Hist. An.</i> i. 17, 497 a 32; iii. 1, 510 a 30;
iv. 1, 525 a 9). The different works are more or less connected by
a system of references, which give rise to difficulties, especially
when they are cross-references: for example, the <i>Analytics</i> and
<i>Topics</i> quote one another: so do the <i>Physics</i> and the <i>Metaphysics</i>;
the <i>De Vita</i> and <i>De Respiratione</i> and the <i>De Partibus
Animalium</i>; this latter treatise and the <i>De Animalium Incessu</i>;
the <i>De Interpretatione</i> and the <i>De Anima</i>. A late work may
quote an earlier; but how, it may be asked, can the earlier
reciprocally quote the later?</p>

<p>Besides these difficulties in and between the works there are
others beyond them. On the one hand, there is the curious story
given partly by Strabo (608-609) and partly in Plutarch&rsquo;s <i>Sulla</i>
(c. 26), that Aristotle&rsquo;s successor Theophrastus left the books
of both to their joint pupil, Neleus of Scepsis, where they were
hidden in a cellar, till in Sulla&rsquo;s time they were sold to Apellicon,
who made new copies, transferred after Apellicon&rsquo;s death by
Sulla to Rome, and there edited and published by Tyrannio and
Andronicus. On the other hand, there are the curious and
puzzling catalogues of Aristotelian books, one given by Diogenes
Laertius, another by an anonymous commentator (perhaps
Hesychius of Miletus) quoted in the notes of Gilles Ménage on
Diogenes Laertius, and known as &ldquo;Anonymus Menagii,&rdquo; and a
third copied by two Arabian writers from Ptolemy, perhaps King
Ptolemy Philadelphus, son of the founder of the library at
Alexandria. (See Rose, <i>Fragm</i>. pp. 1-22.) But the extraordinary
thing is that, without exactly agreeing among themselves, the
catalogues give titles which do not agree well with the Aristotelian
works as we have them. A title in some cases suits a given work
or a part of it; but in other cases there are no titles for works
which exist, or titles for works which do not exist.</p>

<p>These difficulties are complicated by various hypotheses
concerning the composition of the Aristotelian works. Zeller
supposes that, though Aristotle may have made preparations for
his philosophical system beforehand, still the properly didactic
treatises composing it almost all belong to the last period of his
life, <i>i.e.</i> from 335-334 to 322; and from the references of one
work to another Zeller has further suggested a chronological
order of composition during this period of twelve years, beginning
with the treatises on Logic and Physics, and ending with that on
Metaphysics. There is a further hypothesis that the Aristotelian
works were not originally treatises, but notes of lectures either
for or by his pupils. This easily passes into the further and still
more sceptical hypothesis that the works, as we have them, under
Aristotle&rsquo;s name, are rather the works of the Peripatetic school,
from Aristotle, Theophrastus and Eudemus downwards. &ldquo;We
cannot assert with certainty,&rdquo; says R. Shute in his <i>History of the
Aristotelian Writings</i> (p. 176), &ldquo;that we have even got throughout
a treatise in the exact words of Aristotle, though we may be
pretty clear that we have a fair representation of his thought.
The unity of style observable may belong quite as much to the
school and the method as to the individual.&rdquo; This sceptical
conclusion, the contrary of that drawn by Leibnitz from the
harmony of thought and style pervading the works, shows us
that the Homeric question has been followed by the Aristotelian
question.</p>

<p><i>The Solution</i>.&mdash;Such hypotheses attend to Aristotle&rsquo;s philosophy
to the neglect of his life. He was really, as we have seen,
a prolific writer from the time when he was a young man under
Plato&rsquo;s guidance at Athens; beginning with dialogues in the
manner of his master, but afterwards preferring to write didactic
works during the prime of his own life between thirty-eight and
fifty (347-335-334), and with the further advantage of leisure
at Atarneus and Mitylene, in Macedonia and at home in Stagira.
When at fifty he returned to Athens, as head of the Peripatetic
school, he no doubt wrote much of his extant philosophy during
the twelve remaining years of his life (335-322). But he was
then a busy teacher, was growing old, and suffered from a disease
in the stomach for a considerable time before it proved fatal at
the age of sixty-three. It is therefore improbable that he could
between fifty and sixty-three have written almost the whole
of the many books on many subjects constituting that grand
philosophical system which is one of the most wonderful works of
man. It is far more probable that he was previously composing
them at his leisure and in the vigour of manhood, precisely as his
contemporary Demosthenes composed all his great speeches
except the <i>De Corona</i> before he was fifty.</p>

<p>Turning to Aristotle&rsquo;s own works, we immediately light upon
a surprise: Aristotle began his extant scientific works during
Plato&rsquo;s lifetime. By a curious coincidence, in two different
works he mentions two different events as contemporary with
the time of writing, one in 357 and the other in 356. In the
<i>Politics</i> (&Epsilon; 10, 1312 b 10), he mentions as now (<span class="grk" title="nun">&#957;&#8166;&#957;</span>) Dion&rsquo;s
expedition to Sicily which occurred in 357. In the <i>Meteorologica</i>
(iii. 1, 371 a 30), he mentions as now (<span class="grk" title="nun">&#957;&#8166;&#957;</span>) the burning of the
temple at Ephesus, which occurred in 356. To save his hypothesis
of late composition, Zeller resorts to the vagueness of
the word &ldquo;now&rdquo; (<span class="grk" title="nun">&#957;&#8166;&#957;</span>). But Aristotle is graphically describing
isolated events, and could hardly speak of events of 357 and 356
as happening &ldquo;now&rdquo; in or near 335. Moreover, these two works
contain further proofs that they were both begun earlier than this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page507" id="page507"></a>507</span>
date. The <i>Politics</i> (&Beta; 10) mentions as having happened lately
(<span class="grk" title="neosti">&#957;&#949;&#969;&#963;&#964;&#943;</span>) the expedition of Phalaecus to Crete, which occurred
towards the end of the Sacred War in 346. The <i>Meteorologica</i>
(&Gamma; 7) mentions the comet of 341. It is true that the <i>Politics</i>
also mentions much later events, <i>e.g.</i> the assassination of Philip
which took place in 336 (&Epsilon; 10, 1311 b 1-3). Indeed, the whole
truth about this great work is that it remained unfinished at
Aristotle&rsquo;s death. But what of that? The logical conclusion is
that Aristotle began writing it as early as 357, and continued
writing it in 346, in 336, and so on till he died. Similarly, he
began the <i>Meteorologica</i> as early as 356 and was still writing it
in 341. Both books were commenced some years before Plato&rsquo;s
death: both were works of many years: both were destined to
form parts of the Aristotelian system of philosophy. It follows
that Aristotle, from early manhood, not only wrote dialogues
and didactic works, surviving only in fragments, but also began
some of the philosophical works which are still parts of his extant
writings. He continued these and no doubt began others during
the prime of his life. Having thus slowly matured his separate
writings, he was the better able to combine them more and more
into a system, in his last years. No doubt, however, he went on
writing and rewriting well into the last period of his life; for
example, the recently discovered <span class="grk" title="Athaenaion politeia">&#902;&#952;&#951;&#957;&#945;&#943;&#969;&#957; &#960;&#959;&#955;&#953;&#964;&#949;&#943;&#945;</span> mentions
on the one hand (c. 54) the archonship of Cephisophon (329-328),
on the other hand (c. 46) triremes and quadriremes but without
quinqueremes, which first appeared at Athens in 325-324; and
as it mentions nothing later it probably received its final touches
between 320 and 324. But it may have been begun long before,
and received additions and changes. However early Aristotle
began a book, so long as he kept the manuscript, he could always
change it. Finally he died without completing some of his
works, such as the <i>Politics</i>, and notably that work of his whole
philosophic career and foundation of his whole philosophy&mdash;the
<i>Metaphysics</i>&mdash;which, projected in his early criticism of Plato&rsquo;s
philosophy of universal forms, gradually developed into his
positive philosophy of individual substances, but remained
unfinished after all.</p>

<p>On the whole, then, Aristotle was writing his extant works very
gradually for some thirty-five years (357-322), like Herodotus
(iv. 30) contemplated additions, continued writing them more or
less together, not so much successively as simultaneously, and
had not finished writing at his death.</p>

<p>There is a curious characteristic connected with this gradual
composition. An Aristotelian treatise frequently has the appearance
of being a collection of smaller discourses (<span class="grk" title="logoi">&#955;&#972;&#947;&#959;&#953;</span>), as, <i>e.g.</i>,
K.L. Michelet has remarked.</p>

<p>This is obvious enough in the <i>Metaphysics</i>: it has two openings
(Books &Alpha; and &alpha;); then comes a nearly consecutive theory
of being (&Beta;, &Gamma;, &Epsilon;, &Zeta;, &Eta;, &Theta;), but interrupted by a philosophical
lexicon &Delta;; afterwards follows a theory of unity (&Iota;); then a
summary of previous books and of doctrines from the <i>Physics</i> (&Kappa;);
next a new beginning about being, and, what is wanted to complete
the system, a theory of God in relation to the world (&Lambda;);
finally a criticism of mathematical metaphysics (&Mu;, &Nu;), in which
the argument against Plato (&Alpha; 9) is repeated almost word for
word (&Mu; 4-5). The <i>Metaphysics</i> is clearly a compilation formed
from essays or discourses; and it illustrates another characteristic
of Aristotle&rsquo;s gradual method of composition. It refers
back to passages &ldquo;in the first discourses&rdquo; (<span class="grk" title="en tois protois logois">&#7952;&#957; &#964;&#959;&#8150;&#962; &#960;&#961;&#974;&#964;&#959;&#953;&#962; &#955;&#972;&#947;&#959;&#953;&#962;</span>)
&mdash;an expression not uncommon in Aristotelian writings. Sometimes
the reference is to the beginning of the whole treatise;
<i>e.g.</i> <i>Met</i>. &Beta; 2, 997 b 3-5, referring back to &Alpha; 6 and 9 about Platonic
forms. Sometimes, on the other hand, the reference only goes
back to a previous part of a given topic, <i>e.g.</i> <i>Met</i>. &Theta; 1, 1045 b
27-32, referring back to &Zeta; 1, or at the earliest to &Gamma; 2. On
either alternative, however, &ldquo;the first discourses&rdquo; mentioned
may have originally been a separate discourse; for Book &Gamma;
begins quite fresh with the definition of the science of being,
long afterwards called &ldquo;Metaphysics,&rdquo; and Book &Zeta; begins
Aristotle&rsquo;s fundamental doctrine of substance.</p>

<p>Another indication of a treatise having arisen out of separate
discourses is its consisting of different parts imperfectly connected.
Thus the <i>Nicomachean Ethics</i> begins by identifying the good with
happiness (<span class="grk" title="eudaimonia">&#949;&#8016;&#948;&#945;&#953;&#956;&#959;&#957;&#943;&#945;</span>), and happiness with virtuous action.
But when it comes to the moral virtues (Book iii. 6), a new
motive of the &ldquo;honourable&rdquo; (<span class="grk" title="tou kalou eneka">&#964;&#959;&#8166; &#954;&#945;&#955;&#959;&#8166; &#7956;&#957;&#949;&#954;&#945;</span>) is suddenly
introduced without preparation, where one would expect the
original motive of happiness. Then at the end of the moral
virtues justice is treated at inordinate length, and in a different
manner from the others, which are regarded as means between
two vices, whereas justice appears as a mean only because it is
of the middle between too much and too little. Later, the
discussion on friendship (Books viii.-ix.) is again inordinate in
length, and it stands alone. Lastly, pleasure, after having been
first defined (Book vii.) as an activity, is treated over again
(Book x.) as an end beyond activity, with a warning against
confusing activity and pleasure. The probability is that the
<i>Nicomachean Ethics</i> is a collection of separate discourses worked
up into a tolerably systematic treatise; and the interesting point
is that these discourses correspond to separate titles in the list of
Diogenes Laertius (<span class="grk" title="peri kalou, peri dikaion, peri philias, peri haedonaes">&#960;&#949;&#961;&#8054; &#954;&#945;&#955;&#959;&#8166;, &#960;&#949;&#961;&#8054; &#948;&#953;&#954;&#945;&#943;&#969;&#957;,
&#960;&#949;&#961;&#8054; &#966;&#953;&#955;&#943;&#945;&#962;, &#960;&#949;&#961;&#8054; &#7969;&#948;&#959;&#957;&#8134;&#962;</span>, and <span class="grk" title="peri haedonon">&#960;&#949;&#961;&#8054; &#7969;&#948;&#959;&#957;&#8182;&#957;</span>). The same list also refers to tentative
notes (<span class="grk" title="upomnaemata epicheiraematika">&#8016;&#960;&#959;&#956;&#957;&#942;&#956;&#945;&#964;&#945; &#7952;&#960;&#953;&#967;&#949;&#953;&#961;&#951;&#956;&#945;&#964;&#953;&#954;&#940;</span>), and the commentators
speak of ethical notes (<span class="grk" title="aethika upomnaemata">&#7968;&#952;&#953;&#954;&#8048; &#8017;&#960;&#959;&#956;&#957;&#942;&#956;&#945;&#964;&#945;</span>). Indeed, they sometimes
divide Aristotle&rsquo;s works into notes (<span class="grk" title="upomnaematika">&#8017;&#960;&#959;&#956;&#957;&#951;&#956;&#945;&#964;&#953;&#954;&#940;</span>) and
compilations (<span class="grk" title="syntagmatika">&#963;&#965;&#957;&#964;&#945;&#947;&#956;&#945;&#964;&#953;&#954;&#940;</span>). How can it be doubted that in the
gradual composition of his works Aristotle began with notes
(<span class="grk" title="upomnaematika">&#8017;&#960;&#959;&#956;&#957;&#942;&#956;&#945;&#964;&#945;</span>) and discourses (<span class="grk" title="logoi">&#955;&#972;&#947;&#959;&#953;</span>), and proceeded to treatises
(<span class="grk" title="pragmateiai">&#960;&#961;&#945;&#947;&#956;&#945;&#964;&#949;&#943;&#945;&#953;</span>)? He would even be drawn into this process by
his writing materials, which were papyrus rolls of some magnitude;
he would tend to write discourses on separate rolls, and
then fasten them together in a bundle into a treatise.</p>

<p>If then Aristotle was for some thirty-five years gradually and
simultaneously composing manuscript discourses into treatises
and treatises into a system, he was pursuing a process which
solves beforehand the very difficulties which have since been
found in his writings. He could very easily write in different
styles at different times, now avoiding hiatus and now not, sometimes
writing diffusely and sometimes briefly, partly polishing
and partly leaving in the rough, according to the subject, his own
state of health or humour, his age, and the degree to which he had
developed a given topic; and all this even in the same manuscript
as well as in different manuscripts, so that a difference
of style between different parts of a work or between different
works, explicable by one being earlier than another, does not
prove either to be not genuine. As he might write, so might he
think differently in his long career. To put one extreme case,
about the soul he could think at first in the <i>Eudemus</i> like Plato
that it is imprisoned in the body, and long afterwards in the <i>De
Anima</i> like himself that it is the immateriate essence of the
material bodily organism. Again, he might be inconsistent;
now, for example, calling a universal a substance in deference
to Plato, and now denying that a universal can be a substance
in consequence of his own doctrine that every substance is
an individual; and so as to contradict himself in the same
treatise, though not in the same breath or at the same moment
of thinking. Again, in developing his discourses into larger
treatises he might fall into dislocations; although it must be
remembered that these are often inventions of critics who do not
understand the argument, as when they make out that the treatment
of reciprocal justice in the <i>Ethics</i> (v. 5-6) needs rearrangement
through their not noticing that, according to Aristotle,
reciprocal justice, being the fairness of a commercial bargain, is
not part of absolute or political justice, but is part of analogical
or economical justice. Or he might make repetitions, as in the
same book, where he twice applies the principle, that so far as the
agent does the patient suffers, first to the corrective justice of the
law court (<i>Eth</i>. v. 4) in order to prove that in a wrong the injurer
gains as much as the injured loses, and immediately afterwards
to the reciprocal justice of commerce (<i>ib</i>. 5) in order to prove
that in a bargain a house must be exchanged for as many shoes as
equal it in value. Or he might himself, without double versions,
repeat the same argument with a different shade of meaning;
as when in the <i>Nic. Ethics</i> (vii. 4) he first argues that incontinence
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page508" id="page508"></a>508</span>
about such natural pleasures as that of gain is only modified
incontinence, a sign (as <i>causa cognoscendi</i>) of which is that it is not
so bad as incontinence about carnal pleasures, and then argues
that, because (as <i>causa essendi</i>) it is only modified incontinence,
therefore it is not so bad. Or he might return again and again
to the same point with a difference: there is a good instance in
his conclusion that the speculative life is the highest happiness;
which he first infers because it is the life of man&rsquo;s highest and
divine faculty, intelligence (1176 b-1178 a 8), then after an interval
infers a second time because our speculative life is an imitation of
that of God (1178 b 7-32), and finally after another interval infers
a third time, because it will make man most dear to God (1179 a
22-32). Or, extending himself as it were still more, he might
write two drafts, or double versions of his own, on the same
subject; <i>e.g. Physics</i>, vii. and <i>De Anima</i>, ii. Or he might, going
still further, in his long literary career write two or more treatises
on the same subject, different and even more or less inconsistent
with each other, as we shall find in the sequel. Finally, having
a great number of discourses and treatises, containing all those
small blemishes, around him in his library, and determined to
collect, consolidate and connect them into a philosophical system,
he would naturally be often taking them down from their places
to consult and compare one with another, and as naturally enter
in them references one to the other, and cross-references between
one another. Thus he would enter in the <i>Metaphysics</i> a reference
to the <i>Physics</i>, and in the <i>Physics</i> a reference to the <i>Metaphysics</i>,
precisely because both were manuscripts in his library. For the
same purpose of connexion he would be tempted to add a preface
to a book like the <i>Meteorologica</i>. In order to refer back to the
<i>Physics</i>, the <i>De Coelo</i>, and the <i>De Generatione</i>, this work begins by
stating that the first causes of all nature and all natural motion,
the stars ordered according to celestial motion and the bodily
elements with their transmutations, and generation and corruption
have all been discussed; and by adding that there remains
to complete this investigation, what previous investigators called
meteorology. To suppose this preface, presupposing many
sciences, to have been written in 356, when the <i>Meteorologica</i> had
been already commenced, would be absurd; but equally absurd
would it be to reject that date on account of the preface, which
even a modern author often writes long after his book. Nor is it
at all absurd to suppose that, long after he began the <i>Meteorologica</i>,
Aristotle himself added the preface in the process of gathering his
general treatises on natural science into a system. So he might
afterwards add the preface to the <i>De Interpretatione</i>, in order to
connect it with the <i>De Anima</i>, though written afterwards, in order
to connect his treatises on mind and on its expression. So also
he might add the appendix to the <i>Sophistical Elenchi</i>, long after
he had written that book, and perhaps, to judge from its being a
general claim to have discovered the syllogism, when the founder
of logic had more or less realized that he had written a number
of connected treatises on reasoning.</p>

<p><i>The Question of Publication</i>.&mdash;There is still another point which
would facilitate Aristotle&rsquo;s gradual composition of discourses into
treatises and treatises into a system; there was no occasion for
him to publish his manuscripts beyond his school. Printing has
accustomed us to publication, and misled us into applying to
ancient times the modern method of bringing out one book after
another at definite dates by the same author. But Greek authors
contemplated works rather than books. Some of the greatest
authors were not even writers: Homer, Aesop, Thales, Socrates.
Some who were writers were driven to publish by the occasion;
and after the orders of government, which were occasionally
published to be obeyed, occasional poems, such as the poems of
Solon, the odes of Pindar and the plays of the dramatists, which
all had a political significance, were probably the first writings
to be published or, rather, recited and acted, from written
copies. With them came philosophical poems, such as those of
Xenophanes and Empedocles; the epical history of Herodotus;
the dramatic philosophy of Plato. On a larger scale speeches
written by orators to be delivered by litigants were published
and encouraged publication; and, as the Attic orators were his
contemporaries, publication had become pretty common in the
time of Aristotle, who speaks of many bundles (<span class="grk" title="desmas">&#948;&#941;&#963;&#956;&#945;&#962;</span>) of
judicial speeches by Isocrates being hawked about by the booksellers
(<i>Fragm</i>. 140).</p>

<p>No doubt then Aristotle&rsquo;s library contained published copies of
the works of other authors, as well as the autographs of his own.
It does not follow that his own works went beyond his library
and his school. Publication to the world is designed for readers,
who at all times have demanded popular literature rather than
serious philosophy such as that of Aristotle. Accordingly it
becomes a difficult question, how far Aristotle&rsquo;s works were
published in his lifetime. In answering it we must be careful
to exclude any evidence which refers to Aristotle as a man, not
as a writer, or refers to him as a writer but does not prove
publication while he was alive.</p>

<p>Beginning then with his early writings, which are now lost, the
dialogues <i>On Poetry</i> and the <i>Eudemus</i> were probably the published
discourses to which Aristotle himself refers (<i>Poetics</i>, 15; <i>De
Anima</i>, i. 4); and the dialogue <i>Protrepticus</i> was known to the
Cynic Crates, pupil of Diogenes and master of Zeno (<i>Fragm</i>. 50),
but not necessarily in Aristotle&rsquo;s lifetime, as Crates was still
alive in 307. Again, Aristotle&rsquo;s early rhetorical instructions
and perhaps writings, as well as his opinion that a collection of
proverbs is not worth while, must have been known outside
Aristotle&rsquo;s rhetorical school to the orator Cephisodorus, pupil of
Isocrates and master of Demosthenes, for him to be able to write
in his <i>Replies to Aristotle</i> (<span class="grk" title="en tais pros Aristotelaen antigraphais">&#7952;&#957; &#964;&#945;&#8150;&#962; &#960;&#961;&#8056;&#962; &#902;&#961;&#953;&#963;&#964;&#959;&#964;&#941;&#955;&#951;&#957; &#7936;&#957;&#964;&#953;&#947;&#961;&#945;&#966;&#945;&#8150;&#962;</span>)
an admired defence of Isocrates (Dionys. H. <i>De Isoc</i>. 18). But
this early dialectic and rhetoric, being popular, would tend to be
published. History comes nearer to philosophy; and Aristotle&rsquo;s
<i>Constitutions</i> were known to his enemy Timaeus, who attacked
him for disparaging the descent of the Locrians of Italy, according
to Polybius (xii.), who defended Aristotle. But as Timaeus
brought his history down to 264 <span class="scs">B.C.</span> (Polyb. i. 5), and therefore
might have got his information after Aristotle&rsquo;s death, we cannot
be sure that any of the <i>Constitutions</i> were published in the author&rsquo;s
lifetime. We are equally at a loss to prove that Aristotle published
his philosophy. He had, like all the great, many enemies,
personal and philosophical; but in his lifetime they attacked the
man, not his philosophy. In the Megarian school, first Eubulides
quarrelled with him and calumniated him (Diog. Laert. ii. 109)
in his lifetime; but the attack was on his life, not on his writings:
afterwards Stilpo wrote a dialogue (<span class="grk" title="Aristotelaes">&#902;&#961;&#953;&#963;&#964;&#959;&#964;&#941;&#955;&#951;&#962;</span>]), which may
have been a criticism of the Aristotelian philosophy from the
Megarian point of view; but he outlived Aristotle thirty years.
In the absence of any confirmation, &ldquo;the current philosophemata&rdquo;

(i. 9, 279 a 30), are sometimes supposed to be Aristotle&rsquo;s published
philosophy, to which he is referring his readers. But the example
there given, that the divine is unchangeable, is precisely such a
religious commonplace as might easily be a current philosopheme
of Aristotle&rsquo;s day, not of Aristotle; and this interpretation suits
the parallel passage in the <i>Nic. Ethics</i> (i. 5, 1096 a 3) where
opinions about the happiness of political life are said to have been
sufficiently treated &ldquo;even in current discussions&rdquo; (<span class="grk" title="kai en tois
egkukliois">&#954;&#945;&#8054; &#7952;&#957; &#964;&#959;&#8150;&#962; &#7952;&#947;&#954;&#965;&#954;&#955;&#943;&#959;&#953;&#962;</span>).</p>

<p>There is therefore no contemporary proof that Aristotle
published any part of his mature philosophical system in his lifetime.
It is true that a book of Andronicus, as reported by Aulus
Gellius (xx. 5), contained a correspondence between Alexander
and Aristotle in which the pupil complained that his master
had published his &ldquo;acroatic discourses&rdquo; (<span class="grk" title="tous akroatikous ton
logon">&#964;&#959;&#8058;&#962; &#7936;&#954;&#961;&#959;&#945;&#964;&#953;&#954;&#959;&#8058;&#962; &#964;&#8182;&#957; &#955;&#972;&#947;&#969;&#957;</span>). But ancient letters are proverbially forgeries, and in the
three hundred years which elapsed between the supposed correspondence
and the time of Andronicus there was plenty of time
for the forgery of these letters. But even if the correspondence
is genuine, &ldquo;acroatic discourses&rdquo; must be taken to mean what
Alexander would mean by them in the time of Aristotle, and not
what they had come to mean by the time of Andronicus.
Alexander meant those discourses which Aristotle, when he was
his tutor, intended for the ears of himself and his fellow-pupils;
such as the early political works on <i>Monarchy</i> and on <i>Colonies</i>,
and the early rhetorical works, the <i>Theodectea</i>, the <i>Collection of Arts</i>,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page509" id="page509"></a>509</span>
and possibly the <i>Rhetoric to Alexander</i>, in the preface to
which the writer actually says to Alexander: &ldquo;You wrote to me
that nobody else should receive this book.&rdquo; These few early
works may have been published, and contrary to the wishes
of Alexander, without affecting Aristotle&rsquo;s later system. But
even so, Alexander&rsquo;s complaint would not justify writers three
centuries later in taking Alexander to have referred to mature
scientific writings, which were not addressed, and not much
known, to him, the conqueror of Asia; although by the times
of Andronicus and Aulus Gellius, Aristotle&rsquo;s scientific writings
were all called acroatic, or acroamatic, or sometimes esoteric,
in distinction from exoteric&mdash;a distinction altogether unknown
to Aristotle, and therefore to Alexander. In the absence of any
contemporary evidence, we cannot believe that Aristotle in his
lifetime published any, much less all, of his scientific books. The
conclusion then is that Aristotle on the one hand to some extent
published his early dialectical and rhetorical writings, because
they were popular, though now they are lost, but on the other
hand did not publish any of the extant historical and philosophical
works which belong to his mature system, because they were best
adapted to his philosophical pupils in the Peripatetic school.
The object of the philosopher was not the applause of the public
but the truth of things. Now this conclusion has an important
bearing on the composition of Aristotle&rsquo;s writings and on the
difficulties which have been found in them. If he had like a
modern author brought out each of his extant philosophical
works on a definite day of publication, he would not have been
able to change them without a second edition, which in the case
of serious writings so little in demand would not be worth while.
But as he did not publish them, but kept the unpublished manuscripts
together in his library and used them in his school, he was
able to do with them as he pleased down to the very end of his
life, and so gradually to consolidate his many works into one
system.</p>

<p>While Aristotle did not publish his philosophical works to the
world, he freely communicated them to the Peripatetic school.
They are not mere lectures; but he used them for lectures: he
allowed his pupils to read them in his library, and probably to
take copies from them. He also used diagrams, which are
sometimes incorporated in his works, but sometimes are only
mentioned, and were no doubt used for purposes of teaching.
He also availed himself of his pupils&rsquo; co-operation, as we may
judge from his description in the <i>Ethics</i> (x. 7) of the speculative
philosopher who, though he is self-sufficing, is better having
co-operators (<span class="grk" title="synergous hexon">&#963;&#965;&#957;&#949;&#961;&#947;&#959;&#8058;&#962; &#7956;&#967;&#969;&#957;</span>). From an early time he had a
tendency to address his writings to his friends. For example,
he addressed the <i>Theodectea</i> to his pupil Theodectes; and even
in ancient times a doubt arose whether it was a work of the
master or the pupil. It was certainly by Aristotle, because it
contained the triple grammatical division of words into noun,
verb and conjunction, which the history of grammar recognized
as his discovery. But we may explain the share of Theodectes
by supposing that he had a hand in the work (cf. Dionys. H.
<i>De Comp. Verb.</i> 2; Quintilian i. 4. 18). Similarly in astronomy,
Aristotle used the assistance of Eudoxus and Callippus. Indeed,
throughout his writings he shows a constant wish to avail himself
of what is true in the opinions of others, whether they are
philosophers, or poets or ordinary people expressing their
thoughts in sayings and proverbs. With one of his pupils in
particular, Theophrastus, who was born about 370 and therefore
was some fifteen years younger than himself, he had a long and
intimate connexion; and the work of the pupil bears so close a
resemblance to that of his master, that, even when he questions
Aristotle&rsquo;s opinions (as he often does), he seems to be writing in an
Aristotelian atmosphere; while he shows the same acuteness in
raising difficulties, and has caught something of the same encyclopaedic
genius. Another pupil, Eudemus of Rhodes, wrote and
thought so like his master as to induce Simplicius to call him the
most genuine of Aristotle&rsquo;s companions (<span class="grk" title="ho gnaesiotatos ton
Aristotelous hetairon">&#8001; &#947;&#957;&#951;&#963;&#953;&#974;&#964;&#945;&#964;&#959;&#962; &#964;&#8182;&#957; &#902;&#961;&#953;&#963;&#964;&#959;&#964;&#941;&#955;&#959;&#965;&#962; &#7953;&#964;&#945;&#943;&#961;&#969;&#957;</span>). It is probable that this extraordinary
resemblance is due to the pupils having actually assisted their
master; and this supposition enables us to surmount a difficulty
we feel in reading Aristotle&rsquo;s works. How otherwise, we
wonder, could one man writing alone and with so few predecessors
compose the first systematic treatises on the psychology of the
mental powers and on the logic of reasoning, the first natural
history of animals, and the first civil history of one hundred and
fifty-eight constitutions, in addition to authoritative treatises on
metaphysics, biology, ethics, politics, rhetoric and poetry; in all
penetrating to the very essence of the subject, and, what is most
wonderful, describing more facts than any other man has ever
done on so many subjects?</p>

<p><i>The Uncompleted Works</i>.&mdash;Such then was the method of
composition by which Aristotle began in early manhood to
write his philosophical works, continued them gradually and
simultaneously, combined shorter discourses into longer treatises,
compared and connected them, kept them together in his library
without publishing them, communicated them to his school, used
the co-operation of his best pupils, and finally succeeded in
combining many mature writings into one harmonious system.
Nevertheless, being a man, he did not quite succeed. He left
some unfinished; such as the <i>Categories</i>, in which the main part
on categories is not finished, while the last part, afterwards called
postpredicaments, is probably not his, the <i>Politics</i> and the
<i>Poetics</i>. He left others imperfectly arranged, and some of the
most important, the <i>Metaphysics</i>, the <i>Politics</i> and the logical
writings. Of the imperfect arrangement of the <i>Metaphysics</i> we
have already spoken; and we shall speak of that of his logical
writings when we come to the order of his whole system. At
present the <i>Politics</i> will supply us with a conspicuous example
of the imperfect arrangement of some, as well as of the gradual
composition of all, of Aristotle&rsquo;s extant writings.</p>

<p>The <i>Politics</i> was begun as early as 357, yet not finished in 322.
It betrays its origin from separate discourses. First comes a
general theory of constitutions, right and wrong (Books &Alpha;, &Beta;, &Gamma;);
and this part is afterwards referred to as &ldquo;the first discourses&rdquo;
(<span class="grk" title="hen tois protois logois">&#7952;&#957; &#964;&#959;&#8150;&#962; &#960;&#961;&#974;&#964;&#959;&#953;&#962; &#955;&#972;&#947;&#959;&#953;&#962;</span>).  Then follows the treatment of oligarchy,
democracy, commonwealth and tyranny, and of the
various powers of government (&Delta;), and independent investigation
of revolution, and of the means of preserving states (&Epsilon;), and
a further treatment of democracy and oligarchy, and of the
different offices of the state (&Zeta;), and finally a return to the discussion
of the right form of constitution (&Eta;, &Theta;). But &Delta; and &Zeta;
are a group interrupted by &Epsilon;, and &Eta; and &Theta; are another group
unconnected with the previous group and with &Epsilon;, and are also
distinguished in style by avoiding hiatus. Further, the group
(&Delta;, &Zeta;) and the group (&Eta;, &Theta;) are both unfinished. Finally the
group (&Delta;, &Zeta;), the book (&Epsilon;) and the group (&Eta;, &Theta;) though
unconnected with one another, are all connected though imperfectly
with &ldquo;the first discourses&rdquo; (&Alpha;, &Beta;, &Gamma;). This complicated
arrangement may be represented in the following diagram:&mdash;</p>

<div class="center ptb1"><img style="width:389px; height:86px" src="images/img509.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p class="noind">The simplest explanation is that Aristotle began by writing
separate discourses, four at least, on political subjects; that he
continued to write them and perhaps tried to combine them:
but that in the end he failed and left the <i>Politics</i> unfinished and
in disorder. But modern commentators, possessed by the fallacy
that Aristotle like a modern author must from the first have
comtemplated a whole treatise in a regular order for definite
publication, lose themselves in vain disputes as to whether to go
by the traditional order of books indicated by their letters and
known to have existed as early as the abstract (given in Stobaeus,
<i>Ecl.</i> ii. 7) ascribed to Didymus (1st century <span class="scs">A.D.</span>), or to put the
group &Eta;, &Theta;, as more connected with &Alpha;, &Beta;, &Gamma;, before the group
&Delta;, &Zeta;, and this group before the book &Eta;. It is agreed, says Zeller,
that the traditional order contradicts the original plan. But
what right have we to say that Aristotle had an original plan?</p>

<p>The incomplete state in which Aristotle left the <i>Metaphysics</i>,
the <i>Politics</i> and his logical works, brings us to the hard question
how much he did, and how much his Peripatetic followers did
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page510" id="page510"></a>510</span>
to his writings after his death. To answer it we should have
to go far beyond Aristotle. But two corollaries follow from our
present investigation of his extant writings; the first, that it was
the long continuance of the Peripatetic school which gradually
caused the publication, and in some cases the forgery, of the
separate writings; and the second, that his Peripatetic successors
arranged and edited some of Aristotle&rsquo;s writings, and gradually
arrived by the time of Andronicus, the eleventh from Aristotle,
at an order of the whole body of writings forming the system.
Now, it is probable that the arrangement of the works which we
are considering was done by the Peripatetic successors of Aristotle.
There is nothing indeed in the <i>Metaphysics</i> to show whether he
left it in isolated treatises or in its present disorder; and nothing
in the <i>Politics</i>. On the other hand, in the case of logic, it is
certain that he did not combine his works on the subject into one
whole, but that the Peripatetics afterwards put them together as
organic, and made them the parts of logic as an organon, as they
are treated by Andronicus. Perhaps something similar occurred
to the <i>Metaphysics</i>, as Alexander imputed its redaction to
Eudemus, and the majority of ancient commentators attributed
its second opening (Book &alpha;) to Pasicles, nephew of Eudemus.
Again, it is not unlikely that the <i>Politics</i> was arranged in the
traditional order of books by Theophrastus, and that this is the
meaning of the curious title occurring in the list of Aristotle&rsquo;s
works as given by Diogenes Laertius, <span class="grk" title="politikês akroaseos hos
hê theophrastou a&rsquo; b&rsquo; g&rsquo; d&rsquo; e&rsquo; s&rsquo; z&rsquo; ê&rsquo;">&#960;&#959;&#955;&#953;&#964;&#953;&#954;&#8134;&#962; &#7936;&#954;&#961;&#959;&#940;&#963;&#949;&#969;&#962; &#8033;&#962; &#7969; &#920;&#949;&#959;&#966;&#961;&#940;&#963;&#964;&#959;&#965; &#945;&#8189;&#946;&#8189;&#947;&#8189;&#948;&#8189;&#949;&#8189;&#962;&#8189;&#950;&#8189;&#951;&#8189;</span>, which agrees with the <i>Politics</i>
in having eight books. Although, however, we may concede
that such great works as the <i>Metaphysics</i>, the <i>Politics</i> and the
logical writings did not receive their present form from Aristotle
himself, that concession does not deprive Aristotle of the authorship,
but only of the arrangement of those works. On the
contrary, Theophrastus and Eudemus, his immediate followers,
both wrote works presupposing Aristotle&rsquo;s <i>Metaphysics</i> and his
logical works, and Dicaearchus, their contemporary, used his
<i>Politics</i> for his own <i>Tripoliticus</i>. It was Aristotle himself then who wrote these works, whether he arranged them or not; and if he wrote the incomplete works, then <i>a fortiori</i> he wrote the completed works except those which are proved spurious, and
practically consummated the Aristotelian system, which, as
Leibnitz said, by its unity of thought and style evinces its
own genuineness and individuality. We must not exaggerate
the school and underrate the individual, especially such an
individual. What he mainly wanted was the time, the leisure
and the labour, which we have supposed to have been given
to the gradual composition of the extant Aristotelian writings.
Aristotle, asked where dwell the Muses, answered, &ldquo;In the souls
of those who love work.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="pt2 center sc">IV. Earlier and Later Writings</p>

<p>Aristotle&rsquo;s quotations of his other books and of historical
facts only inform us at best of the dates of isolated passages,
and cannot decide the dates and sequences of whole philosophical
books which occupied him for many years. Is there then any
way of discriminating between early and late works? There is
the evidence of the influences under which the books were written.
This evidence applies to the whole Aristotelian literature including
the fragments. As to the fragments, we are safe in saying
that the early dialogues in the manner of Plato were written
under the influence of Plato, and that the subsequent didactic
writings connected with Alexander were written more under
the influence of Philip and Alexander. Turning to the extant
writings, we find that some are more under the influence of Plato,
while others are more original and Aristotelian. Also some
writings are more rudimentary than others on the same subject;
and some have the appearance of being first drafts of others.
By these differences we can do something to distinguish between
earlier and later philosophical works; and also vindicate as
genuine some works, which have been considered spurious because
they do not agree in style or in matter with his most mature
philosophy. In thirty-five years of literary composition, Aristotle
had plenty of time to change, because any man can differ from
himself at different times.</p>

<p>On these principles, we regard as early genuine philosophical
works of Aristotle, (1) the <i>Categories</i>, (2) the <i>De Interpretatione</i>;(3)
the <i>Eudemian Ethics</i> and <i>Magna Moralia</i>; (4) the <i>Rhetoric to Alexander</i>.</p>

<p>1. The Categories (<span class="grk" title="kataegoriai">&#954;&#945;&#964;&#951;&#947;&#959;&#961;&#943;&#945;&#953;</span>).&mdash;This short discourse turns on
Aristotle&rsquo;s fundamental doctrine of individual substances, without
which there is nothing. He arrives at it from a classification
of categories, by which he here means &ldquo;things stated in no
combination&rdquo; (<span class="grk" title="ta kata maedemian symplokaen legomena">&#964;&#8048; &#954;&#945;&#964;&#8048; &#956;&#951;&#948;&#949;&#956;&#943;&#945;&#957; &#963;&#965;&#956;&#960;&#955;&#959;&#954;&#8052;&#957; &#955;&#949;&#947;&#972;&#956;&#949;&#957;&#945;</span>) or what
we should call &ldquo;names,&rdquo; capable of becoming predicates
(<span class="grk" title="kataegoroumena, kataegoriai">&#954;&#945;&#964;&#951;&#947;&#959;&#961;&#959;&#973;&#956;&#949;&#957;&#945; &#954;&#945;&#964;&#951;&#947;&#959;&#961;&#943;&#945;&#953;</span>). &ldquo;Every name,&rdquo; says he (chap. 4),
&ldquo;signifies either substance or something quantitative, or qualitative, or relative, or somewhere, or sometimes, or that
it is in a position, or in a condition, or active or passive.&rdquo;
He immediately adds that, by the combination of these
names with one another, affirmation or negation arises. The
categories then are names signifying things capable of becoming
predicates in a proposition. Next he proceeds to substances
(<span class="grk" title="ousiai">&#959;&#8016;&#963;&#943;&#945;&#953;</span>), which he divides into primary (<span class="grk" title="protai">&#960;&#961;&#8182;&#964;&#945;&#953;</span>) and secondary
(<span class="grk" title="deuterai">&#948;&#949;&#973;&#964;&#949;&#961;&#945;&#953;</span>). &ldquo;Substance&rdquo;, says he (chap. 5), &ldquo;which is properly, primarily and especially so called, is that which is neither a
predicate of a subject nor inherent in a subject; for example,
a particular man, or a particular horse. Secondary substances
so called are the species in which are the primarily called
substances, and the genera of these species: for example, a
particular man is in a species, man, the genus of which is animal:
these then are called secondary substances, man and animal.&rdquo;
Having made these subdivisions of substance, he thereupon
reduces secondary substances and all the rest of the categories
to belongings of individual or primary substances. &ldquo;All other
things&rdquo;, says he, &ldquo;are either predicates of primary substances as
subjects&rdquo; (<span class="grk" title="kath&rsquo; hypokeimenon ton proton ousion">&#954;&#945;&#952;&#8125; &#8017;&#960;&#959;&#954;&#949;&#953;&#956;&#941;&#957;&#969;&#957; &#964;&#8182;&#957; &#960;&#961;&#974;&#964;&#969;&#957; &#959;&#8016;&#963;&#953;&#8182;&#957;</span>)
&ldquo;or inherent in them as subjects&rdquo; (<span class="grk" title="en hypokeimenais autais">&#7952;&#957; &#8017;&#960;&#959;&#954;&#949;&#953;&#956;&#941;&#957;&#945;&#953;&#962; &#945;&#8016;&#964;&#945;&#8150;&#962;</span>). He explains that
species and genus are predicates of, and that other categories
(<i>e.g.</i> the quality of colour) are inherent in, some individual
substance such as a particular man. Then follows his conclusion:
&ldquo;without primary substances it is impossible for anything to be&rdquo;
(<span class="grk" title="mae ouson oun ton proton ousion adunaton ton hallon ti einai">&#956;&#8052; &#959;&#8016;&#963;&#8182;&#957; &#959;&#8167;&#957; &#964;&#8182;&#957; &#960;&#961;&#974;&#964;&#969;&#957; &#959;&#8016;&#963;&#953;&#8182;&#957; &#964;&#8182;&#957; &#7940;&#955;&#955;&#969;&#957; &#964;&#953; &#949;&#7990;&#957;&#945;&#953;</span>.
<i>Cat.</i> 5, 2 b 5-6).</p>

<p>Things are individual substances, without which there is
nothing&mdash;this is the fundamental point of Aristotelianism, as
against Platonism, of which the fundamental point is that things
are universal forms without which there becomes nothing. The
world, according to Aristotle, consists of substances, each of
which is a separate individual, this man, this horse, this animal,
this plant, this earth, this water, this air, this fire; in the
heavens that moon, that sun, those stars; above all, God. On
the other hand, a universal species or genus of substances is a
predicate which, as well as everything else in all the other categories,
always belongs to some individual substance or other as
subject, and has no separate being. In full, then, a substance is
a separate individual, having universals, and things in all other
categories, inseparably belonging to it. The individual substance
Socrates, for example, is a man and an animal (<span class="grk" title="ousia">&#959;&#8016;&#963;&#943;&#945;</span>), tall,
(<span class="grk" title="poson">&#960;&#959;&#963;&#972;&#957;</span>), white (<span class="grk" title="poion">&#960;&#959;&#953;&#972;&#957;</span>), a husband (<span class="grk" title="pros ti">&#960;&#961;&#972;&#962; &#964;&#953;</span>), in the market (<span class="grk" title="pou">&#960;&#959;&#8166;</span>),
yesterday (<span class="grk" title="pote">&#960;&#972;&#964;&#949;</span>), sitting (<span class="grk" title="keisthai">&#954;&#949;&#8150;&#963;&#952;&#945;&#953;</span>), armed
(<span class="grk" title="hechein">&#7956;&#967;&#949;&#953;&#957;</span>), talking (<span class="grk" title="poiein">&#960;&#959;&#953;&#949;&#8150;&#957;</span>), listening (<span class="grk" title="paschein">&#960;&#940;&#963;&#967;&#949;&#953;&#957;</span>). Aristotelianism is this philosophy
of substantial things.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>The doctrine that all things are substances which are separate
individuals, stated in the <i>Categories</i>, is expanded in the <i>Metaphysics</i>.
Both works arrive at it from the classification of categories, which
is the same in both; except that in the former the categories are
treated rather as a logical classification of names signifying things,
in the latter rather as a metaphysical classification of things. In
neither, however, are they a grammatical classification of words by
their structure; and in neither are they a psychological classification
of notions or general conceptions (<span class="grk" title="noaemata">&#957;&#959;&#942;&#956;&#945;&#964;&#945;</span>), such as they afterwards
became in Kant&rsquo;s <i>Critique</i> and the post-Kantian idealism.
Moreover, even in the <i>Categories</i> as names signifying distinct things
they imply distinct things; and hence the <i>Categories</i>, as well
as the <i>Metaphysics</i>, draws the metaphysical conclusion that individual
substances are the things without which there is nothing else, and
thereby lays the positive foundation of the philosophy running
through all the extant Aristotelian writings.</p>

<p>Again, according to both works, an individual substance is a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page511" id="page511"></a>511</span>
subject, a universal its predicate; and they have in common the
Aristotelian metaphysics, which differs greatly from the modern
logic of subject and predicate. Subject (<span class="grk" title="upokeimenon">&#8017;&#960;&#959;&#954;&#949;&#943;&#956;&#949;&#957;&#959;&#957;</span>) originally
meant a real thing which is the basis of something, and was used
by Aristotle both for a thing to which something belongs and for
a name of which another is asserted: accordingly &ldquo;predicate&rdquo;
(<span class="grk" title="kataegoroymenon">&#954;&#945;&#964;&#951;&#947;&#959;&#961;&#959;&#973;&#956;&#949;&#957;&#959;&#957;</span>) came with him to mean something really belonging
(<span class="grk" title="uparchon">&#8017;&#960;&#940;&#961;&#967;&#959;&#957;</span>) to a substance as real subject, as well as a name capable of
being asserted of a name as a nominal subject. In other words, to
him subject meant real as well as nominal subject, and predicate
meant real as well as nominal predicate; whereas modern logic
has gradually reduced both to the nominal terms of a proposition.
Accordingly, when he said that a substance is a subject, he meant a
real subject; and when he said that a universal species or genus
is a predicate, he meant that it is a real predicate belonging to a
real subject, which is always some individual substance of the
kind. It follows that Aristotelianism in the <i>Categories</i> and in the
<i>Metaphysics</i> is a realism both of individuals and of universals;
of individual substances as real subjects, and of universals as
real predicates.</p>

<p>Lastly, the two works agree in reducing the <i>Categories</i> to substance
and its belongings (<span class="grk" title="uparchonta">&#8017;&#960;&#940;&#961;&#967;&#959;&#957;&#964;&#945;</span>). According to both, it is always
some substance, such as Socrates, which is quantitative, qualitative,
relative, somewhere, some time, placed, conditioned, active, passive;
so that all things in all other categories are attributes which are
belongings of substances. There are therefore two kinds of belongings,
universals and attributes; and in both cases belonging in the sense
of having no being but the being of the substance.</p>

<p>In brief then the common ground of the <i>Categories</i> and the <i>Metaphysics</i>
is the fundamental position that all things are substances
having belonging to them universals and attributes, which have no
separate being as Plato falsely supposed.</p>

<p>This essential agreement suffices to show that the <i>Categories</i> and
the <i>Metaphysics</i> are the result of one mind. Nevertheless, there is a
deep difference between them in detail, which may be expressed by
saying that the <i>Categories</i> is nearer to Platonism. We have seen how
anxious Aristotle was to be considered one of the Platonists, how
reluctant he was to depart from Plato&rsquo;s hypothesis of forms, and
how, in denying the separability, he retained the Platonic belief in the
reality and even in the unity of the universal. We have now to see
that, in writing the <i>Categories</i>, on the one hand he carried his differences
from his master further than he had done in his early criticisms
by insisting that individual substances are not only real, but are the
very things which sustain the universal; but on the other hand, he
clung to further relics of the Platonic theory, and it is those which
differentiate the <i>Categories</i> and the <i>Metaphysics</i>.</p>

<p>In the first place, in the <i>Categories</i> the belonging of things in other
categories to individual substances in the first category is not so
well developed. A distinction (chap. 2) is drawn between things
which are predicates of a subject (<span class="grk" title="kath upokeimenon">&#954;&#945;&#952;&#8125; &#8017;&#960;&#959;&#954;&#949;&#943;&#956;&#949;&#957;&#959;&#957;</span>) and things which
inhere in a subject (<span class="grk" title="en ipokeimeno">&#7952;&#957; &#8017;&#960;&#959;&#954;&#949;&#953;&#956;&#941;&#957;&#8179;</span>); and, while universals are called
predicates of a subject, things in a subordinate category, <i>i.e.</i> attributes
such as colour (<span class="grk" title="chroma">&#967;&#961;&#8182;&#956;&#945;</span>) in the qualitative, are said to inhere in
a subject. It is true that the work gives only a negative definition of
the inherent, namely, that it does not inhere as a part and cannot
exist apart from that in which it inheres (1 a 24-25), and it admits that
what is inherent may sometimes also be a predicate (chap. 5, 2 a 27-34).
The commentators explain this to mean that an attribute as individual
is inherent, as universal is a predicate. But even so the
<i>Categories</i> concludes that everything is either a predicate of, or
inherent in, a substance; and the view that this colour belongs to
this substance only in the sense of being in it, not of it, leaves the
impression that, like a Platonic form, it is an entity rather in than of
an individual substance, though even in the <i>Categories</i> Aristotle is
careful to deny its separability. The hypothesis of inherence gives
an inadequate account of the dependence of an attribute on a substance,
and is a kind of half-way house between separation and
predication.</p>

<p>On the other hand, in the <i>Metaphysics</i>, the distinction between
inherence and predication disappears; and what is more, the relation
of an attribute to a substance is regarded as so close that an attribute
is merely the substance modified. &ldquo;The thing itself and the thing
affected,&rdquo; says Aristotle, &ldquo;are in a way the same; <i>e.g.</i> Socrates and
Socrates musical&rdquo; (<i>Met.</i> &Delta; 29, 1024 b 30-31). Consequently, all
attributes, as well as universals, belong as predicates of individual
substances as subjects, according to the <i>Metaphysics</i>, and also according
to the most authoritative works of Aristotle, such as the <i>Posterior
Analytics</i>, where (cf. i. 4, 22) an attribute (<span class="grk" title="symbebaekos">&#963;&#965;&#956;&#946;&#949;&#946;&#951;&#954;&#972;&#962;</span>) is said to be
only by being the substance possessing it, and any separation of an
attribute from a substance is held to be entirely a work of human
abstraction (<span class="grk" title="aphairesis">&#7936;&#966;&#945;&#943;&#961;&#949;&#963;&#953;&#962;</span>). At this point, Plato and Aristotle have
become very far apart: to the master beauty appears to be an
independent thing, and really separate, to the pupil at his best only
something beautiful, an attribute which is only mentally separable
from an individual substance. The first difference then between
the <i>Categories</i> and the <i>Metaphysics</i> is in the nature of an attribute;
and the theory of inherence in the <i>Categories</i> is nearer to Plato and
more rudimentary than the theory of predication in the <i>Metaphysics</i>.
The second difference is still nearer to Plato and more rudimentary,
and is in the nature of substance. For though both works rest on
the reality of individual substances, the <i>Categories</i> (chap. 5) admits
that universal species and genera can be called substances, whereas
the <i>Metaphysics</i> (&Zeta; 13) denies that a universal can be a substance
at all.</p>

<p>It is evident that in the category of substance, as Aristotle perceived,
substance is predicate of substance, <i>e.g.</i> Socrates (<span class="grk" title="ousia">&#959;&#8016;&#963;&#943;&#945;</span>) is a
man (<span class="grk" title="ousia">&#959;&#8016;&#963;&#943;&#945;</span>), and an animal (<span class="grk" title="ousia">&#959;&#8016;&#963;&#943;&#945;</span>). The question then arises,
what sort of substance can be predicate; and in the <i>Categories</i>
Aristotle gave an answer, which would have been impossible, if he
had not, under Plato&rsquo;s influence, accepted both the unity and the
substantiality of the universal. What he said in consequence was
that the substance in the predicate is not an individual substance,
<i>e.g.</i> this man or this animal, because such a primary substance is not
a predicate; but that the species man or the genus animal is the
substance which is the predicate of Socrates the subject (<i>Cat.</i> 5, 3 a
36 seq.). Finding then that substances are real predicates, and
supposing that in that case they must be species or genera, he could
not avoid the conclusion that some substances are species or genera,
which were therefore called by him &ldquo;secondary substances,&rdquo; and by
his Latin followers <i>substantiae universales</i>. It is true that this conclusion
gave him some misgivings, because he recognized that it is
a characteristic of a substance to signify an individual (<span class="grk" title="tose ti">&#964;&#972;&#948;&#949; &#964;&#953;</span>),
which a species or a genus does not signify (<i>ib.</i> 5, 3 b 10-21). Nevertheless,
in the <i>Categories</i>, he did not venture to deny that in the
category of substance a universal species (<i>e.g.</i> man), or genus (<i>e.g.</i>
animal), is itself a substance. On the other hand, in the <i>Metaphysics</i>
(&Zeta; 13), he distinctly denies that any universal can be a substance,
on the ground that a substance is a subject, whereas a universal is
a predicate and a belonging of a subject, from which it follows as
he says that no universal is a substance, and no substance universal.
Here again the <i>Categories</i> forms a kind of transition from Platonism to
the <i>Metaphysics</i> which is the reverse: to call universals &ldquo;secondary
substances&rdquo; is half way between Plato&rsquo;s calling them the only
substances and Aristotle&rsquo;s denial in the <i>Metaphysics</i> that they are
substances at all.</p>

<p>What conclusion are we to draw from these differences between the
<i>Categories</i> and the <i>Metaphysics</i>? The only logical conclusion is that
the <i>Categories</i>, being nearer to Plato on the nature of attributes, and
still nearer on the relation of universals to substances, is earlier than
the <i>Metaphysics</i>. There are difficulties no doubt in drawing this
conclusion; because the <i>Metaphysics</i>, though it denies that universals
can be substances, and does not allow species and genera to be
called &ldquo;secondary substances,&rdquo; nevertheless falls itself into calling
a universal essence (<span class="grk" title="to ti aen einai">&#964;&#8056; &#964;&#943; &#7974;&#957; &#949;&#7990;&#957;&#945;&#953;</span>) a substance&mdash;and that too in
the very book where it is proved that no universal can be a substance.
But this lapse only shows how powerful a dominion Plato
exercised over Aristotle&rsquo;s soul to the last; for it arises out of the
pupil still accepting from his master the unity of the universal though
now applying it, not to classes, but to essences. The argument about
essences in the <i>Metaphysics</i> is as follows:&mdash;Since a separate individual,
<i>e.g.</i> Socrates, is a substance, and he is essentially a rational animal,
then his essence, being what he is, is a substance; for we cannot
affirm that Socrates is a substance and then deny that this rational
animal is a substance (<i>Met.</i> &Zeta; 3). Now, according to the unity of a
universal asserted by Plato and accepted by Aristotle, the universal
essence of species, being one and the same for all individuals of the
kind, is the same as the essence of each individual: <i>e.g.</i> the rational
animal in the human species and in Socrates is one and the same;
&ldquo;for the essence is indivisible&rdquo; (<span class="grk" title="atomon gar to eisos">&#7940;&#964;&#959;&#956;&#959;&#957; &#947;&#8048;&#961; &#964;&#8056; &#949;&#7990;&#948;&#959;&#962;</span>, <i>Met.</i> &Zeta; 8,
1034 <i>a</i> 8). It follows that we must call this selfsame essence, at once
individual and universal, substance&mdash;a conclusion, however, which
Aristotle never drew in so many words, though he continued always
to call essence substance, and definition a knowledge of substance.</p>

<p>There is therefore a history of Aristotle&rsquo;s metaphysical views,
corresponding to his gradual method of composition. It is as
follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>(1) Negative rejection of Plato&rsquo;s hypothesis of forms and formal
numbers, and reduction of forms to the common in the early
dialogue <span class="grk" title="peri philosophias">&#960;&#949;&#961;&#8054; &#966;&#953;&#955;&#959;&#963;&#959;&#966;&#943;&#945;&#962;</span> and in the early work <span class="grk" title="peri iseon">&#960;&#949;&#961;&#8054; &#7984;&#948;&#949;&#8182;&#957;</span>.</p>

<p>(2) Positive assertion of the doctrine that things are individual
substances in the <i>Categories</i>, but with the admission that attributes
sometimes inhere in substance without being predicates of it, and
that universal species and genera are &ldquo;secondary substances.&rdquo;</p>

<p>(3) Expansion of the doctrine that things are individual substances
in the <i>Metaphysics</i>, coupled with the reduction of all attributes to
predicates, and the direct denial of universal substances; but nevertheless
calling the universal essence of a species of substances
substance, because the individual essence of an individual substance
really is that substance, and the universal essence of the whole species
is supposed to be indivisible and therefore identical with the individual
essence of any individual of the species.</p>
</div>

<p>2. The <i>De Interpretatione</i>.&mdash;Another example of Aristotle&rsquo;s
gradual desertion of Plato is exhibited by the <i>De Interpretatione</i>
as compared with the <i>Prior Analytics</i>, and it shows another
gradual history in Aristotle&rsquo;s philosophy, namely, the development
of subject, predicate and copula, in his logic.</p>

<p>The short discourse on the expression of thought by language
(<span class="grk" title="peri Ermaeneias">&#960;&#949;&#961;&#8054; &#904;&#961;&#956;&#951;&#957;&#949;&#943;&#945;&#962;</span>, <i>De Interpretatione</i>) is based on the Platonic
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page512" id="page512"></a>512</span>
division of the sentence (<span class="grk" title="logos">&#955;&#972;&#947;&#959;&#962;</span>) into noun and verb (<span class="grk" title="onoma">&#8004;&#957;&#959;&#956;&#945;</span> and
<span class="grk" title="rema">&#8165;&#8134;&#956;&#945;</span>.) Its point is to separate the enunciative sentence, or that
in which there is truth or falsity, from other sentences; and then,
dismissing the rest to rhetoric or poetry (where we should say
grammar), to discuss the enunciative sentence (<span class="grk" title="apophantikos logos">&#7936;&#960;&#959;&#966;&#945;&#957;&#964;&#953;&#954;&#8056;&#962; &#955;&#972;&#947;&#959;&#962;</span>),
or enunciation (<span class="grk" title="apophansís">&#7936;&#960;&#959;&#966;&#945;&#957;&#963;&#943;&#962;</span>), or what we should call the proposition
(<i>De Int.</i> chap. 4). Here Aristotle, starting from the previous
grammar of sentences in general, proceeded, for the first time in
philosophical literature, to disengage the logic of the proposition,
or that sentence which can alone be true or false, whereby it alone
enters into reasoning. But in spite of this great logical achievement,
he continued throughout the discourse to accept Plato&rsquo;s
grammatical analysis of all sentences into noun and verb, which
indeed applies to the proposition as a sentence but does not give
its particular elements. The first part of the work confines itself
strictly to noun and verb, or the form of proposition called
<i>secundi adjacentis</i>. Afterwards (chap. 10) proceeding to the
opposition of propositions, he adds the form called <i>tertii
adjacentis</i>, in a passage which is the first appearance, or rather
adumbration, of the verb of being as a copula. In the
form <i>secundi adjacentis</i> we only get oppositions, such as the
following:&mdash;</p>

<table class="reg" summary="poem"><tr><td> <div class="poemr">
    <p>man is&mdash;man is not</p>
    <p>not-man is&mdash;not-man is not</p>
</div> </td></tr></table>

<p class="noind">In the form <i>tertii adjacentis</i> the oppositions, becoming more
complex, are doubled, as follows:&mdash;</p>

<table class="reg" summary="poem"><tr><td> <div class="poemr">
    <p>man is just&mdash;man is not just</p>
    <p>man is non-just&mdash;man is not non-just</p>
    <p>not-man is just&mdash;not-man is not just</p>
    <p>not-man is non-just&mdash;not-man is not non-just.</p>
</div> </td></tr></table>

<p>The words introducing this form (<span class="grk" title="dtan de to esti triton
proskategoretai">&#948;&#964;&#945;&#957; &#948;&#8050; &#964;&#8056; &#7956;&#963;&#964;&#953; &#964;&#961;&#943;&#964;&#959;&#957; &#960;&#961;&#959;&#963;&#954;&#945;&#964;&#951;&#947;&#959;&#961;&#8134;&#964;&#945;&#953;</span>, chap. 10, 19 b 19), which are the origin of the
phrase <i>tertii adjacentis</i>, disengage the verb of being (<span class="grk" title="esti">&#7956;&#963;&#964;&#953;</span>) partially
but not entirely, because they still treat it as an extra part of the
predicate, and not as a distinct copula. Nor does the work get
further than the analysis of some propositions into noun and verb
with &ldquo;is&rdquo; added to the predicated verb; an analysis, however,
which was a great logical discovery and led Aristotle further to
the remark that &ldquo;is&rdquo; does not mean &ldquo;exists&rdquo;; <i>e.g.</i> &ldquo;Homer is
a poet&rdquo; does not mean &ldquo;Homer exists&rdquo; (<i>De Int.</i> chap. 11).</p>

<p>How then did Aristotle get further in the logical analysis of
the proposition? Not in the <i>De Interpretatione</i>, but in the <i>Prior
Analytics</i>. The first adumbration was forced upon him in the
former work by his theory of opposition; the complete appearance
in the latter work by his theory of syllogism. In analysing
the syllogism, he first says that a premiss is an affirmative or
negative sentence, and then that a term is that into which a
premiss is dissolved, <i>i.e.</i> predicate and subject, combined or
divided by being and not being (<i>Pr. An.</i> i. 1). Here, for the first
time in logical literature, subject and predicate suddenly appear
as terms, or extremes, with the verb of being (<span class="grk" title="to einai">&#964;&#8056; &#949;&#7990;&#957;&#945;&#953;</span>) or not
being (<span class="grk" title="to me einai">&#964;&#8056; &#956;&#8052; &#949;&#7990;&#957;&#945;&#953;</span>) completely disengaged from both, but connecting
them as a copula. Why here? Because the crossing of
terms in a syllogism requires it. In the syllogism &ldquo;Every man
is mortal and Socrates is a man,&rdquo; if in the minor premiss the
copula &ldquo;is&rdquo; were not disengaged from the predicate &ldquo;man,&rdquo;
there would not be one middle term &ldquo;man&rdquo; in the two premisses.
It is not necessary in every proposition, but it is necessary in the
arrangement of a syllogism, to extricate the terms of its propositions
from the copula; <i>e.g.</i> mortal&mdash;man&mdash;Socrates.</p>

<p>This important difference between the <i>De Interpretatione</i> and
the <i>Prior Analytics</i> can only be explained by supposing that the
former is the earlier treatise. It is nearer to Plato&rsquo;s analysis of
the sentence, and no logician would have gone back to it, after
the Prior Analytics. It is not spurious, as some have supposed,
nor later than the <i>De Anima</i>, as Zeller thought, but Aristotle
in an earlier frame of mind.</p>

<p>Moreover we can make a history of Aristotle&rsquo;s thought and
gradual composition thus:</p>

<p>(1) Earlier acceptance in the <i>De Interpretatione</i> of Plato&rsquo;s
grammatical analysis of the sentence into noun and verb (<i>secundi
adjacentis</i>) but gradually disengaging the proposition, and
afterwards introducing the verb of being as a third thing added
(<i>tertium adjacens</i>) to the predicated verb, for the purpose of
opposition.</p>

<p>(2) Later logical analysis in the <i>Prior Analytics</i> of the proposition
as premiss into subject, predicate and copula, for the purpose
of syllogism; but without insisting that the original form is
illogical.</p>

<p>3. The <i>Eudemian Ethics</i> and <i>Magna Moralia</i> in relation to
the <i>Nicomachean Ethics.</i>&mdash;Under the name of Aristotle, three
treatises on the good of man have come down to us, <span class="grk" title="Ethika
Nikomacheia">&#905;&#952;&#953;&#954;&#8048; &#925;&#953;&#954;&#959;&#956;&#940;&#967;&#949;&#953;&#945;</span> (<span class="grk" title="pros Nikomachon">&#960;&#961;&#8056;&#962; &#925;&#953;&#954;&#972;&#956;&#945;&#967;&#959;&#957;</span>, Porphyry), <span class="grk" title="Ethika Eudemia">&#905;&#952;&#953;&#954;&#8048; &#917;&#8016;&#948;&#942;&#956;&#953;&#945;</span>
(<span class="grk" title="pros Eudemon">&#960;&#961;&#8056;&#962; &#917;&#8020;&#948;&#951;&#956;&#959;&#957;</span>, Porphyry), and <span class="grk" title="Ethika Megala">&#905;&#952;&#953;&#954;&#8048; &#956;&#949;&#947;&#940;&#955;&#945;</span>; so like one another
that there seems no tenable hypothesis except that they are the
manuscript writings of one man. Nevertheless, the most usual
hypothesis is that, while the <i>Nicomachean Ethics</i> (<i>E.N.</i>) was
written by Aristotle to Nicomachus, the <i>Eudemian</i> (<i>E.E.</i>) was
written, not to, but by, Eudemus, and the <i>Magna Moralia</i> (<i>M.M.</i>)
was written by some early disciple before the introduction of
Stoic and Academic elements into the Peripatetic school. The
question is further complicated by the fact that three Nicomachean
books (<i>E.N.</i> v.-vii.) and three Eudemian (<i>E.E.</i> &Delta;-&Zeta;)
are common to the two treatises, and by the consequent question
whether, on the hypothesis of different authorship, the common
books, as we may style them, were written for the <i>Nicomachean</i>
by Aristotle, or for the <i>Eudemian Ethics</i> by Eudemus, or some by
one and some by the other author. Against the &ldquo;Chorizontes,&rdquo;
who have advanced various hypotheses on all these points without
convincing one another, it may be objected that they have
not considered Aristotle&rsquo;s method of gradual and simultaneous
composition of manuscripts within the Peripatetic school. We
have to remember the traces of his separate discourses, and his
own double versions; and that, as in ancient times Simplicius,
who had two versions of the <i>Physics</i>, Book vii., suggested that
both were early versions of Book viii. on the same subject, so
in modern times Torstrik, having discovered that there were two
versions of the <i>De Anima</i>, Book ii., suggested that both were by
Aristotle. Above all, we must consider our present point that
Platonic influence is a sign of earliness in an Aristotelian work;
and generally, the same man may both think and write differently
at different times, especially if, like Aristotle, he has been a
prolific author.</p>

<p>These considerations make it probable that the author of all
three treatises was Aristotle himself; while the analysis of the
treatises favours the hypothesis that he wrote the <i>Eudemian
Ethics</i> and the <i>Magna Moralia</i> more or less together as the
rudimentary first drafts of the mature <i>Nicomachean Ethics</i>.</p>

<p>As the Platonic philosophy was primarily moral, and its metaphysics
a theory of the moral order of the universe, Aristotle from
the first must have mastered the Platonic ethics. At first he
adopted the somewhat ascetic views of his master about soul and
body, and about goods of body and estate; but before Plato&rsquo;s
death he had rejected the hypothesis of forms, formal numbers
and the form of the good identified with the one, by which Plato
tried to explain moral phenomena; while his studies and teaching
on rhetoric and poetry soon began to make him take a more
tolerant view than Plato did of men&rsquo;s passions. Throughout his
whole subsequent life, however, he retained the fundamental
doctrine, which he had learnt from Plato, and Plato from
Socrates, that virtue is essential to happiness. Twice over this
tenet, which makes Socrates, Plato and Aristotle one ethical
school, inspired Aristotle to attempt poetry: first, in the Elegy
to Eudemus of Cyprus, in which, referring to either Socrates or
Plato, he praises the man who first showed clearly that a good and
happy man are the same (<i>Fragm.</i> 673); and secondly, in the
Hymn in memory of Hermias, beginning &ldquo;Virtue, difficult to
the human race, noblest pursuit in life&rdquo; (<i>ib.</i> 675). Moreover, the
successors of Plato in the Academy, Speusippus and Xenocrates,
showed the same belief in the essentiality of virtue. The question
which divided them was what the good is. Speusippus took the
ascetic view that the good is a perfect condition of neutrality
between two contrary evils, pain and pleasure. Xenocrates
took the tolerant view that it is the possession of appropriate
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page513" id="page513"></a>513</span>
virtue and noble actions, requiring as conditions bodily and
external goods. Aristotle was opposed to Speusippus, and nearly
agreed with Xenocrates. According to him, the good is activity
of soul in accordance with virtue in a mature life, requiring as
conditions bodily and external goods of fortune; and virtue is a
mean state of the passions. It is probable that when, after
Plato&rsquo;s death and the accession of Speusippus in 347, Aristotle
with Xenocrates left Athens to visit his former pupil Hermias,
the three discussed this moderate system of Ethics in which the
two philosophers nearly agreed. At any rate, it was adopted in
each of the three moral treatises which pass under the name of
Aristotle.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>The three treatises are in very close agreement throughout, and
in the following details. The good of Ethics is human good; and
human good is happiness, not the universal good or form of the
good to which Plato subordinated human happiness. Happiness is
activity of soul according to virtue in a mature life: it requires other
goods only as conditions. The soul is partly irrational, partly
rational; and therefore there are two kinds of virtue. Moral virtue,
which is that of the irrational desires so far as they are obedient to
reason, is a purposive habit in the mean. The motive of the moral
virtues is the honourable (<span class="grk" title="to kalon">&#964;&#8056; &#954;&#945;&#955;&#972;&#957;</span>, <i>honestum</i>). As the rational is
either deliberative or scientific, either practical or speculative
intellect, there are two virtues of the intellect&mdash;prudence of the
deliberative or practical, and wisdom of the scientific or speculative,
intellect. The right reason by which moral virtue is determined is
prudence, which is determined in its turn by wisdom. Pleasure is a
psychical state, and is not a generation in the body supplying a defect
and establishing a natural condition, but an activity of a natural
condition of the soul. It should be specially noted that this doctrine
like the rest is common to the three treatises: in Book vii. of the
<i>Nicomachean</i>, which is &Zeta; of the <i>Eudemian</i>, pleasure is defined as
<span class="grk" title="energeia taes kata thusin exeos anempodistos">&#7952;&#957;&#941;&#961;&#947;&#949;&#953;&#945; &#964;&#8134;&#962; &#954;&#945;&#964;&#8048; &#966;&#973;&#963;&#953;&#957; &#7956;&#958;&#949;&#969;&#962; &#7936;&#957;&#949;&#956;&#960;&#972;&#948;&#953;&#963;&#964;&#959;&#962;</span> (chap. 12, 1153 a 14-15);
and in the <i>Magna Moralia</i> as <span class="grk" title="hae kinaesis autou kai hae energeia">&#7969; &#954;&#7984;&#957;&#951;&#963;&#953;&#962; &#945;&#8016;&#964;&#959;&#8166; &#954;&#945;&#8054; &#7969; &#7952;&#957;&#941;&#961;&#947;&#949;&#953;&#945;</span>
(ii. 7, 1204 b 28; cf. 1205 b 20-28). It is plain from the context
that in the former definition &ldquo;the natural condition&rdquo; (<span class="grk" title="hae kata
thusin exis">&#7969; &#954;&#945;&#964;&#8048; &#966;&#973;&#963;&#953;&#957; &#7956;&#958;&#953;&#962;</span>) refers to the soul which, while the body is regenerated,
remains unimpaired (cf. 1152 b 35 seq., 1154 b 15 seq.); and in the
latter definition the thing (<span class="grk" title="autou">&#945;&#8016;&#964;&#959;&#8166;</span>), whose &ldquo;motion, that is activity&rdquo;
is spoken of, is the part of the soul with which we feel pleased.</p>

<p>Down then to their common definition of pleasure as activity the
three treatises present a harmonious system of morals, consistently
with one another, and with the general philosophy of Aristotle.
In particular, the theory that pleasure is activity (<span class="grk" title="energeia">&#7952;&#957;&#941;&#961;&#947;&#949;&#953;&#945;</span>) is the
theory of two of his most authoritative works. In the <i>De Anima</i>
(iii. 7, 431 a 10-12), being pleased and pained are defined by him as
acting <span class="grk" title="to">&#964;&#8056;</span> (<span class="grk" title="energein">&#7952;&#957;&#949;&#961;&#947;&#949;&#8150;&#957;</span>) by a sensitive mean in relation to good or evil
as such. In the <i>Metaphysics</i> (&Lambda; 7, 1072 b 16), in discussing the occupation
of God, he says &ldquo;his pleasure is activity,&rdquo; or &ldquo;his activity
is pleasure,&rdquo; according to a difference of readings which makes no
difference to the identification of pleasure and activity (<span class="grk" title="energeia">&#7952;&#957;&#941;&#961;&#947;&#949;&#953;&#945;</span>).
As then we find this identification of pleasure with activity in the
<i>Metaphysics</i> and in the <i>De Anima</i>, as well as in the <i>Nicomachean
Ethics</i>, the <i>Eudemian Ethics</i> and the <i>Magna Moralia</i>, the only logical
conclusion, from which there is no escape, is that, so far as the treatment
of pleasure goes, any Aristotelian treatise which defines it as
activity is genuine. There is no reason for doubting that the <i>Nicomachean
Ethics</i> to the end of Book vii., the <i>Eudemian Ethics</i> to the
end of Book &Zeta;, and the <i>Magna Moralia</i> as far as Book ii. chap. 7,
were all three written by Aristotle.</p>

<p>Why then doubt at all? It is because the <i>Nicomachean Ethics</i>
contains a second discourse on pleasure (x. 1-5), in which the author,
while agreeing with the previous treatment of the subject that
pleasure is not a bodily generation, even when accompanied by it,
but something psychical, nevertheless defines it (x. 4, 1174 b 31-33)
not as an activity, but as a supervening end (<span class="grk" title="epigignomenon ti telos">&#7952;&#960;&#953;&#947;&#953;&#947;&#957;&#972;&#956;&#949;&#957;&#972;&#957; &#964;&#953; &#964;&#941;&#955;&#959;&#962;</span>)
perfecting an activity (<span class="grk" title="teleioi taen energeian">&#964;&#949;&#955;&#949;&#953;&#959;&#8150; &#964;&#8052;&#957; &#7952;&#957;&#941;&#961;&#947;&#949;&#953;&#945;&#957;</span>). He allows indeed
that activity and pleasure are very closely related; that a
pleasure of sense or thought perfects an act of sensation or of thinking,
depends on it, and is so inseparably conjoined with it as to raise
a doubt whether pleasure is end of life or life end of pleasure, and even
whether the activity is the same as the pleasure. But he disposes
of this doubt in a very emphatic and significant manner. &ldquo;Pleasure,&rdquo;
says he, &ldquo;does not seem to be thinking or perceiving; for it is absurd:
but on account of not being separated from them, it appears to some
persons to be the same.&rdquo; Now it is not likely that Aristotle either,
after having so often identified pleasure with activity, would say that
the identification is absurd though it appears true to some persons, of
whom he would in that case be one, or, having once disengaged the
pleasure of perceiving and thinking from the acts of perceiving and
thinking, would go backwards and confuse them. It is more likely
that Aristotle identified pleasure with activity in the <i>De Anima</i>, the
<i>Metaphysics</i> and the three moral treatises, as we have seen; but
that afterwards some subsequent Peripatetic, considering that the
pleasure of perceiving or thinking is not the same as perceiving or
thinking, declared the previous identification of pleasure with activity
absurd. At any rate, if we are to choose, it is the identification that
is Aristotle&rsquo;s, and the distinction not Aristotle&rsquo;s. Moreover, the
distinction between activity and pleasure in the tenth book is really
fatal to the consistency of the whole <i>Nicomachean Ethics</i>, which
started in the first book with the identification of happiness and
virtuous activity. For if the pleasure of virtuous activity is a supervening
end beyond the activity, it becomes a supervening end beyond
the happiness of virtuous activity, which thus ceases to be the final
end. Nevertheless, the distinction between activity and pleasure
is true. Some unknown Peripatetic detected a flaw in the <i>Nicomachean
Ethics</i> when he said that pleasure is a supervening end
beyond activity, and, if he had gone on to add that happiness is also
a supervening end beyond the virtuous activities which are necessary
to produce it, he would have destroyed the foundation of his own
founder&rsquo;s Ethics.</p>

<p>It is further remarkable that the <i>Nicomachean Ethics</i> proceeds to a
different conclusion. After the intrusion of this second discourse on
pleasure, it goes on (<i>E.N.</i> x. 6-fin.) to the famous theory that the
highest happiness is the speculative life of intellect or wisdom as
divine, but that happiness as human also includes the practical life
of combining prudence and moral virtue; and that, while both lives
need external goods as necessaries, the practical life also requires
them as instruments of moral action. The treatise concludes with
the means of making men virtuous; contending that virtue requires
habituation, habituation law, law legislative art, and legislative art
politics: Ethics thus passes into Politics. The <i>Eudemian Ethics</i>
proceeds to its conclusion (<i>E.E.</i> &Eta; 13-15) differently, with the
consideration of (1) good fortune (<span class="grk" title="eutuchia">&#949;&#8016;&#964;&#965;&#967;&#943;&#945;</span>), and (2) gentlemanliness
(<span class="grk" title="kalokagathia">&#954;&#945;&#955;&#959;&#954;&#7936;&#947;&#945;&#952;&#943;&#945;</span>). Good fortune it divides into two kinds, both
irrational; one divine, according to impulse, and more continuous;
the other contrary to impulse and not continuous. Gentlemanliness
it regards as perfect virtue, containing all particular virtues, and all
goods for the sake of the honourable. Finally, it concludes with the
limit (<span class="grk" title="horos">&#8005;&#961;&#959;&#962;</span>) of goods. First it finds the limit of goods of fortune in
that desire and possession of them which will conduce to the
contemplation of God, whereas that which prevents the service and
contemplation of God is bad. Then it adds that the best limit of the
soul is as little as possible to perceive the other part of the soul
(<i>i.e.</i> desire). Finally, the treatise concludes with saying that the limit
of gentlemanliness has thus been stated, meaning that its limit is
the service and contemplation of God and the control of desire by
reason. The <i>Magna Moralia</i> (<i>M.M.</i> ii. 8-10) on these points is
unlike the <i>Nicomachean</i>, and like the <i>Eudemian Ethics</i> in discussing
good fortune and gentlemanliness, but it discusses them in a more
worldly way. On good fortune (ii. 8), after recognizing the necessity
of external goods to happiness, it denies that fortune is due to
divine grace, and simply defines it as irrational nature (<span class="grk" title="alogos
thusis">&#7940;&#955;&#959;&#947;&#959;&#962; &#966;&#973;&#963;&#953;&#962;</span>). Gentlemanliness (ii. 9) it regards as perfect virtue, and
defines the gentleman as the man to whom really good things are
good and really honourable things honourable. It then adds (ii. 10)
that acting according to right reason is when the irrational part of
the soul does not hinder the rational part of intellect from doing its
work. Thereupon it proceeds to a discourse on friendship, which in
the <i>Nicomachean</i> and <i>Eudemian Ethics</i> is discussed in an earlier
position, but breaks off unfinished.</p>

<p>On the whole, the three moral treatises proceed on very similar
lines down to the common identification of pleasure with activity,
and then diverge. From this point the <i>Eudemian Ethics</i> and the
<i>Magna Moralia</i> become more like one another than like the <i>Nicomachean
Ethics</i>. They also become less like one another than before:
for the treatment of good fortune, gentlemanliness, and their limit
is more theological in the <i>Eudemian Ethics</i> than in the <i>Magna
Moralia</i>.</p>

<p>How are the resemblances and differences of the three to be
explained? By Aristotle&rsquo;s gradual method of composition. All
three are great works, contributing to the origin of the independent
science of Ethics. But the <i>Eudemian Ethics</i> and the <i>Magna Moralia</i>
are more rudimentary than the <i>Nicomachean Ethics</i>, which as it were
seems to absorb them except in the conclusion. They are, in short,
neither independent works, nor mere commentaries, but Aristotle&rsquo;s
first drafts of his Ethics.</p>

<p>In the <i>Ethics to Eudemus</i>, as Porphyry properly called the
<i>Eudemian Ethics</i>, Aristotle in the first four books successively
investigates happiness, virtue, the voluntary and the particular moral
virtues, in the same order and in the same letter and spirit as in his
<i>Ethics to Nicomachus</i>. But the investigations are never so good.
They are all such rudiments as Aristotle might well polish into the
more developed expositions in the first four books of the <i>Nicomachean
Ethics</i>. On the other hand, nobody would have gone back
afterwards on his masterly treatment of happiness, in the first book,
or of virtue in the second, or of the voluntary in the third, or of the
particular virtues in the third and fourth, to write the sketchy
accounts of the <i>Eudemian Ethics</i>.</p>

<p>Again, these sketches are rough preparations for the subsequent
books common to the two treatises. It is true, as Dr Henry Jackson
has pointed out, though with some exaggeration, that the Eudemian
agrees in detail rather better than the Nicomachean treatment of the
voluntary with the subsequent discussion of injury (<i>E.E.</i> &Delta; = <i>E.N.</i>
v. 8); and, as Th. H. Fritzsche remarks, the distinction between
politics, and economics, and prudence in the <i>Eudemian Ethics</i> (&Alpha; 8)
is a closer anticipation of the subsequent triple distinction of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page514" id="page514"></a>514</span>
practical science (<i>E.E.</i> &Epsilon; = <i>E.N.</i> vi 8). On the other hand, there
are still more fundamental points in which the first three books of
the <i>Eudemian Ethics</i> are a very inadequate preparation for the
common books. Notably its treatment of prudence (<span class="grk" title="phronaesis">&#966;&#961;&#972;&#957;&#951;&#963;&#953;&#962;</span>) is a
chaos. At first, prudence appears as the operation of the philosophical
life and connected with the speculative philosophy of
Anaxagoras (<i>E.E.</i> &Alpha; 1-5): then it is brought into connexion with
the practical philosophy of Socrates (<i>ib</i>. 5) and co-ordinated with
politics and economics (<i>ib</i>. 8); then it is intruded into the diagram
of moral virtues as a mean between villainy (<span class="grk" title="panourgia">&#960;&#945;&#957;&#959;&#965;&#961;&#947;&#943;&#945;</span>) and simplicity
((<span class="grk" title="euhaetheia">&#949;&#8016;&#942;&#952;&#949;&#953;&#945;</span>) (E.E. B 33, 1221 a 12); finally, a distinction
between virtue by nature and virtue with prudence (<span class="grk" title="metha phronhaeseos">&#956;&#949;&#964;&#8048; &#966;&#961;&#959;&#957;&#942;&#963;&#949;&#969;&#962;</span>)
is promised (<i>E.E.</i> &Tau; 7, 1234 a 4). In addition to all this confusion
of speculative and practical knowledge, prudence is absent when it
ought to be present; <i>e.g.</i> from the division of virtues into moral and
intellectual (<i>E.E.</i> &Beta; 1, 1220 a 4-13), and from the definition of
moral virtue (<i>ib</i>. 5, 10); while, in a passage (&Beta; 11) anticipating the
subsequent discussion of the relation between prudence and moral
virtue (<i>E.E.</i> &Epsilon; = <i>E.N.</i> vi. 12-13), it is stated that in purpose the end
is made right by moral virtue, the means by another power, reason,
without this right reason being stated to be prudence. After this,
it can never be said that the earlier books of the <i>Eudemian Ethics</i> are
so good a preparation as those of the <i>Nicomachean Ethics</i> for the
distinction between prudence (<span class="grk" title="phrhoraesis">&#966;&#961;&#972;&#957;&#951;&#963;&#953;&#962;</span>) and wisdom (<span class="grk" title="sophia">&#963;&#959;&#966;&#943;&#945;</span>), which
is the main point of the common books, and one of Aristotle&rsquo;s main
points against Plato&rsquo;s philosophy.</p>

<p>Curiously enough, although little is made of it, this distinction,
absent from the earlier books, is present in the final book II of the
<i>Eudemian Ethics</i> (cf. 1246 b 4 seq., 1248 a 35, 1249 b 14); and probably
therefore this part was a separate discourse. Meanwhile, however,
the truth about the <i>Eudemian Ethics</i> in general is that it was an
earlier rudimentary sketch written by Aristotle, when he was still
struggling, without quite succeeding, to get over Plato&rsquo;s view that
there is one philosophical knowledge of universal good, by which
not only the dialectician and mathematician must explain the being
and becoming of the world, but also the individual and the statesman
guide the life of man. Indeed, the final proof that the <i>Eudemian
Ethics</i> is earlier than the <i>Nicomachean</i> is the very fact that it
is more under Platonic influence. In the first place, the reason
why the account of prudence begins by confusing the speculative
with the practical is that the <i>Eudemian Ethics</i> starts from Plato&rsquo;s
<i>Philebus</i>, where, without differentiating speculative and practical
knowledge, Plato asks how far good is prudence (<span class="grk" title="phronaesis">&#966;&#961;&#972;&#957;&#951;&#963;&#953;&#962;</span>), how
far pleasure (<span class="grk" title="haedorhae">&#7969;&#948;&#959;&#957;&#942;</span>); and in the <i>Eudemian Ethics</i> Aristotle asks
the same question, adding virtue (<span class="grk" title="harethae">&#7936;&#961;&#949;&#964;&#942;</span>) in order to correct the
Socratic confusion of virtue with prudence.  Secondly, the <i>Eudemian
Ethics</i>, while not agreeing with Plato&rsquo;s <i>Republic</i> that the just can
be happy by justice alone, does not assign to the external goods of
good fortune (<span class="grk" title="ehutuchia">&#949;&#8016;&#964;&#965;&#967;&#943;&#945;</span>) the prominence accorded to them in the
<i>Nicomachean Ethics</i> as the necessary conditions of all virtue, and
the instruments of moral virtue. Thirdly, the emphasis of the
<i>Eudemian Ethics</i> on the perfect virtue of gentlemanliness
(<span class="grk" title="kalokhagathia">&#954;&#945;&#955;&#959;&#954;&#7936;&#947;&#945;&#952;&#943;&#945;</span>) is a decidedly old-fashioned trait, which descended
to Aristotle from the Greek notion of a gentleman who does his
duty to his state (cf. Herodotus i. 30, Thucydides iv. 40) and
to his God (Xenophon, <i>Symp</i>. iv. 49) through Plato, who in the
<i>Gorgias</i> (470 E) says that the gentleman is happy, and in the <i>Republic</i>
(489 E) imputes to him the love of truth essential to philosophy.
Moreover, when Plato goes on (<i>ib.</i> 505 <span class="scs">B</span>) to identify the form of
good, without which nothing is good, with the gentlemanly thing
(<span class="grk" title="kalhon kai agathon">&#954;&#945;&#955;&#8056;&#957; &#954;&#945;&#8054; &#7936;&#947;&#945;&#952;&#972;&#957;</span>), without which any possession is worthless, he
inspired into the author of the <i>Eudemian Ethics</i> the very limit (<span class="grk" title="opos">&#8005;&#961;&#959;&#962;</span>) of good fortune and gentlemanliness with which it concludes, only
without Plato&rsquo;s elevation of the good into the form of the good.
In the <i>Nicomachean Ethics</i> the old notion, we gladly see, survives
(cf. i. 8): virtuous actions are gentlemanly actions, and happiness accordingly is being at our best and noblest and pleasantest (<span class="grk" title="ariston kai kalliston kai aediston">&#7940;&#961;&#953;&#963;&#964;&#959;&#957; &#954;&#945;&#8054; &#954;&#940;&#955;&#955;&#953;&#963;&#964;&#959;&#957; &#954;&#945;&#8054; &#7972;&#948;&#953;&#963;&#964;&#959;&#957;</span>). But gentlemanliness
is no longer called perfect virtue, as in the <i>Eudemian Ethics</i>: its place has been taken
by justice, which is perfect virtue to one&rsquo;s neighbour, by prudence
which unites all the moral virtues, and by wisdom which is the highest
virtue. Accordingly, in the end the old ideal of gentlemanliness is
displaced by the new ideal of the speculative and practical life.</p>

<p>Lastly, the <i>Eudemian Ethics</i> derives from Platonism a strong
theological bias, especially in its conclusion (&Eta; 14-15). The opposition
of divine good fortune according to impulse to that which is
contrary to impulse reminds us of Plato&rsquo;s point in the <i>Phaedrus</i> that
there is a divine as well as a diseased madness. The determination of
the limit of good fortune and of gentlemanliness by looking to the
ruler, God, who governs as the end for which prudence gives its
orders, and the conclusion that the best limit is the most conducive
to the service and contemplation of God, presents the Deity and
man&rsquo;s relation to him as a final and objective standard more
definitely in the <i>Eudemian</i> than in the <i>Nicomachean Ethics</i>, which
only goes so far as to say that man&rsquo;s highest end is the speculative
wisdom which is divine, like God, dearest to God.</p>

<p>Because, then, it is very like, but more rudimentary and more
Platonic, we conclude that the <i>Eudemian</i> is an earlier draft of the
<i>Nicomachean Ethics</i>, written by Aristotle when he was still in process
of transition from Plato&rsquo;s ethics to his own.</p>

<p>The <i>Magna Moralia</i> contains similar evidence of being earlier than
the <i>Nicomachean Ethics</i>. It treats the same subjects, but always in
a more rudimentary manner; and its remarks are always such as
would precede rather than follow the masterly expositions of the
<i>Nicomachean Ethics</i>. This inferiority applies also to its treatment
not only of the early part (i. 1-33 corresponding to <i>E.N.</i> i.-iv.), but
also of the middle part (i. 34-11. 7 corresponding to <i>E.N.</i> v.-vii. =
<i>E.E.</i> &Delta;-&Zeta;). In dealing with justice, it does not make it clear, as the
<i>Nicomachean Ethics</i> (Book v.) does, that even universal justice is
virtue towards another (<i>M.M.</i> i. 34, 1193 b 1-15), and it omits
altogether the division into distributive and corrective justice. In
dealing with what the <i>Nicomachean Ethics</i> (Book vi.) calls intellectual
virtues, but the <i>Magna Moralia</i> (i. 5, 35) virtues of the
rational part of the soul, and right reason, it distinguishes (i. 35,
1196 b 34-36) science, prudence, intelligence, wisdom, apprehension
(<span class="grk" title="upolaepsis">&#8017;&#960;&#972;&#955;&#951;&#968;&#953;&#962;</span>), in a rough manner very inferior to the classification
of science, art, prudence, intelligence, wisdom, all of which are coordinate
states of attaining truth, in the <i>Nicomachean Ethics</i> (vi. 3).
It distinguishes prudence (<span class="grk" title="phronaesis">&#966;&#961;&#972;&#957;&#951;&#963;&#953;&#962;</span>) and wisdom (<span class="grk" title="sophia">&#963;&#959;&#966;&#943;&#945;</span>) as the
respective virtues of deliberative and scientific reason; and on the
whole its account of prudence (cf. <i>M.M.</i> i. 5) is more consistent than
that of the <i>Eudemian Ethics</i>. In these points it is a better preparation
for the <i>Nicomachean Ethics</i>. But it falls into the confusion of
first saying that praise is for moral virtues, and not for virtues of the
reason, whether prudence or wisdom (<i>M.M.</i> i. 5, 1185 b 8-12), and
afterwards arguing that prudence is a virtue, precisely because it is
praised (i. 35, 1197 a 16-18). In dealing with continence and incontinence,
the same doubts and solutions occur as in the <i>Nicomachean
Ethics</i> (Book vii. = <i>E.E.</i> &Zeta;), but sometimes confusing doubts and
solutions together, instead of first proposing all the doubts and then
supplying the solutions as in the <i>Nicomachean Ethics</i>. Such rudimentary
and imperfect sketches would be quite excusable in a first
draft, but inexcusable and incredible after the <i>Nicomachean Ethics</i>
had been written.</p>

<p>It has another characteristic which points to its being an early work
of Aristotle, when he was still under the influence of Plato&rsquo;s style;
namely its approximation to dialogue. It asks direct questions
(<i>e.g.</i> <span class="grk" title="dia ti">&#948;&#953;&#8048; &#964;&#943;</span>; <i>M.M.</i> i. 1 repeatedly, 12; ii. 6, 7), incorporates direct
statements of others (<i>e.g.</i> <span class="grk" title="phaesi">&#966;&#951;&#963;&#943;</span>, i. 12, 13; ii. 3, 6, 7), alternates
direct objections and answers (i. 34), and introduces conversations
between the author and others, expressed interrogatively, indicatively
and even imperatively (<span class="grk" title="all erei moi, ta poia diasaphaeson hygieina estin">&#7936;&#955;&#955;&#8125; &#7952;&#961;&#949;&#8150; &#956;&#959;&#953;, &#964;&#8048; &#960;&#959;&#8150;&#945; &#948;&#953;&#945;&#963;&#940;&#966;&#951;&#963;&#959;&#957; &#8017;&#947;&#953;&#949;&#953;&#957;&#940; &#7952;&#963;&#964;&#953;&#957;</span>.
i. 35, 1196 b 10; cf. ii. 10, 1208 a 20-22). The whole treatise
inclines to run into dialogue. It is also Platonic, like the <i>Endemian
Ethics</i>, in making little of external goods in the account of good
fortune (ii. 8), and in emphasizing the perfect virtue of gentlemanliness
(ii. 9). Indeed, in some respects it is more like the <i>Eudemian</i>,
though in the main more like the <i>Nicomachean Ethics</i>. In the first
book, it has the Eudemian distinction between prudence, virtue and
pleasure (i. 3, 1184 b 5-6); but does not make so much of it as the
distinction between prudence and wisdom blurred in the <i>Eudemian</i>
but defined in the <i>Nicomachean Ethics</i>. In the second book, it runs
parallel to the <i>Eudemian Ethics</i> in placing good fortune and gentlemanliness
(ii. 8-9), where the <i>Nicomachean Ethics</i> places the speculative
and the practical life; but it omits the theological element
by denying that good fortune is divine grace, and by submitting
gentlemanliness to no standard but that of right reason, when the
irrational part of the soul does not hinder the rational part, or
intellect (<span class="grk" title="nous">&#957;&#959;&#8166;&#962;</span>), from doing its work.</p>

<p>Because, then, the <i>Magna Moralia</i> is very like the <i>Nicomachean
Ethics</i>, but more rudimentary, nearer to the Platonic dialogues in
style and. to a less degree in matter, and also like the <i>Eudemian
Ethics</i>, we conclude that it is also like that treatise in having been
written as an earlier draft of the <i>Nicomachean Ethics</i> by Aristotle
himself.</p>

<p>The hypothesis that the <i>Eudemian Ethics</i>, and by consequence the
<i>Magna Moralia</i>, are later than Aristotle has arisen from a simple
misconception, continued in a Scholium attributed to Aspasius, who
lived in the 2nd century <span class="scs">A.D.</span> Nicomachean means &ldquo;addressed to
Nicomachus,&rdquo; and Eudemian &ldquo;addressed to Eudemus&rdquo;; but, as
Cicero thought that the <i>Nicomachean Ethics</i> was written by Nicomachus,
so the author of the Scholium thought that the <i>Eudemian
Ethics</i>, at least so far as the first account of pleasure goes, was written
by Eudemus. He only thought so, however, because Aristotle
could not have written both accounts of pleasure; and, taking for
granted that Aristotle had written the second account of pleasure in
the <i>Nicomachean Ethics</i> (Book x.), he concluded that the first
account (Book vii.) was not the work of Aristotle, but of Eudemus
(<i>Comm. in Ar.</i> (Berlin) xix. p. 151). We have seen reason to reverse
this argument: Aristotle did write the first account in Book vii.,
because it contains his usual theory; and, if we must choose, he did
not write the second account in Book x. In this way, too, we get a
historical development of the theory of pleasure: Plato and Speusippus
said it is generation (cf. Plato&rsquo;s <i>Philebus</i>): Aristotle said it is
psychical activity sometimes requiring bodily generation, sometimes
not (<i>E.N.</i> vii. = <i>E.E.Z</i>): Aristotle, or some Aristotelian, afterwards
said that it is a supervening end completing an activity (E.N. x.).
Secondly, some modern commentators, starting from the false conclusion
that the definition of pleasure as activity (<i>E.N.</i> vii. = <i>E.E.Z</i>) is
by Eudemus, and supposing without proof that he was also author of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page515" id="page515"></a>515</span>
the first three books of the <i>Eudemian Ethics</i>, have further asserted
that these are a better introduction than the first four books of
the <i>Nicomachean Ethics</i> to the books common to both treatises
(<i>E.N.</i> Books v.-vii. = <i>E.E.</i> Books &Delta;-&Zeta;), and have concluded that
Eudemus wrote these common books. But we have seen that
Aristotle wrote the first three books of the <i>Eudemian</i> as an
earlier draft of the <i>Nicomachean Ethics</i>; so that, even so far as
they form a better introduction, this will not prove the common
books to be by Eudemus. Again, those first three books are a
better introduction only in details; whereas in regard to the
all-important subject of prudence as distinct from wisdom, they
are so bad an introduction that the common book which discusses
that subject at large (<i>E.N.</i> Book vi. = <i>E.E.</i> Book &Epsilon;) must be rather
founded on the first four books of Aristotle&rsquo;s <i>Nicomachean Ethics</i>.
Further, as Aristotle wrote both the first three Eudemian and the
first four Nicomachean books, there is no reason why sometimes one,
sometimes the other, should not be the best introduction to the
common books by the same author. Finally, the common books are
so integral a part of the Aristotelian system of philosophy that they
cannot be disengaged from it: the book on justice (<i>E.N.</i> v.) quotes
and is quoted in the <i>Politics</i> (cf. 1130 b 28, 1280 a 16, 1261 a 30); the
book on intellectual virtues (<i>E.N.</i> vi.) quotes (vi. 3) the <i>Posterior
Analytics</i>, i. 2, and is quoted in the <i>Metaphysics</i> (&Alpha; 1); and we have
seen that the book (<i>E.N.</i> vii.) which defines pleasure as activity
is simply stating an Aristotelian commonplace. Thirdly, in order to
prove that the <i>Eudemian Ethics</i> was by Eudemus, it is said that in
its first part it contemplates that there must be a limit (<span class="grk" title="oros">&#8004;&#961;&#959;&#962;</span>) for
virtue as a mean (<i>E.E.</i> &Beta; 5, 1222 b 7-8), in its middle part it criticizes
the <i>Nicomackean Ethics</i> for not being clear about this limit (<i>E.E.</i> &Epsilon; 1),
and in the end it alone assigns this limit, in the service and contemplation
of God (<i>E.E.</i> &Eta; 15, 1249 b 16 seq.). This argument is subtle,
but over-subtle. The <i>Eudemian</i> and the <i>Nicomachean</i> treatments
of this subject do not really differ. In the <i>Nicomachean</i> as in the
<i>Eudemian Ethics</i> the limit above moral virtue is right reason, or
prudence, which is right reason on such matters; and above prudence
wisdom, for which prudence gives its orders; while wisdom is the
intelligence and science of the most venerable objects, of the most
divine, and of God. After this agreement, there is a shade of difference.
While the <i>Eudemian Ethics</i> in a more theological vein emphasizes
God, the object of wisdom as the end for which prudence gives
its orders, the Nicomachean Ethics in a more humanizing spirit
emphasizes wisdom itself, the speculative activity, as that end, and
afterwards as the highest happiness, because activity of the divine
power of intellect, because an imitation of the activity of God,
because most dear to God. This is too fine a distinction to found a
difference of authorship. Beneath it, and behind the curious hesitation
which in dealing with mysteries Aristotle shows between the
divine and the human, his three moral treatises agree that wisdom
is a science of things divine, which the <i>Nicomachean Ethics</i> (vi. 7)
defines as science and intelligence of the most venerable things, the
<i>Magna Moralia</i> (i. 35) regards as that which is concerned with the
eternal and the divine, and the <i>Eudemian Ethics</i> (&Eta; 15) elevates into
the service and contemplation of God.</p>
</div>

<p>Aristotle then wrote three moral treatises, which agree in the
fundamental doctrines that happiness requires external fortune,
but is activity of soul according to virtue, rising from morality
through prudence to wisdom, or that science of the divine which
constitutes the theology of his <i>Metaphysics</i>. Surely, the harmony
of these three moral gospels proves that Aristotle wrote them,
and wrote the <i>Eudemian Ethics</i> and the <i>Magna Moralia</i> as preludes
to the Nicomachean Ethics. When did he begin? We do
not know; but there is a pathetic suggestiveness in a passage in
the <i>Magna Moralia</i> (i. 35), where he says, &ldquo;Clever even a bad
man is called; as Mentor was thought clever, but prudent he
was not.&rdquo; Mentor was the treacherous contriver of the death of
Hermias (345-344 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>). Was this passage written when Aristotle
was mourning for his friend?</p>

<p>4. <i>The Rhetoric to Alexander</i>.&mdash;This is one of a series of works
emanating from Aristotle&rsquo;s early studies in rhetoric, beginning
with the <i>Gryllus</i>, continuing in the <i>Theodectea</i> and the <i>Collection
of Arts</i>, all of which are lost except some fragments; while
among the extant Aristotelian writings as they stand we still
possess the <i>Rhetoric to Alexander</i> (<span class="grk" title="Rhaetorikae pros Alexandron">&#8172;&#951;&#964;&#959;&#961;&#953;&#954;&#8052; &#960;&#961;&#8056;&#962; &#902;&#955;&#941;&#958;&#945;&#957;&#948;&#961;&#959;&#957;</span>)
and the <i>Rhetoric</i> (<span class="grk" title="Techyn Rhaetorikae">&#932;&#7952;&#967;&#957;&#951; &#8172;&#951;&#964;&#959;&#961;&#953;&#954;&#942;</span>). But the <i>Rhetoric to Alexander</i>
was considered spurious by Erasmus, for the inadequate reasons
that it has a preface and is not mentioned in the list of Diogenes
Laertius, and was assigned by Petrus Victorius, in his preface to
the <i>Rhetoric</i>, to Anaximenes. It remained for Spengel to entitle
the work <i>Anaximenis Ars Rhetorica</i> in his edition of 1847, and
thus substitute for the name of the philosopher Aristotle that of
the sophist Anaximenes on his title-page. We have therefore to
ask, first who was the author, and secondly what is the relation
of the <i>Rhetoric to Alexander</i> to the <i>Rhetoric</i>, which nowadays alone
passes for genuine.</p>

<p>After a dedicatory epistle to Alexander (chap, 1) the opening of
the treatise itself (chap. 2) is as follows:&mdash;&ldquo;There are three genera
of political speeches; one deliberative, one declamatory, one
forensic: their species are seven; hortative, dissuasive, laudatory,
vituperative, accusatory, defensive, critical.&rdquo; This brief sentence
is enough to prove the work genuine, because it was Aristotle
who first distinguished the three genera (cf. <i>Rhet</i>. i. 3; Quintilian
iii. 4, 1. 7, 1), by separating the declamatory (<span class="grk" title="epideiktikon">&#7952;&#960;&#953;&#948;&#949;&#953;&#954;&#964;&#953;&#954;&#972;&#957;</span>)
from the deliberative (<span class="grk" title="daempaegorikon, symbouleutikon">&#948;&#951;&#956;&#951;&#947;&#959;&#961;&#953;&#954;&#972;&#957;, &#963;&#965;&#956;&#946;&#959;&#965;&#955;&#949;&#965;&#964;&#953;&#954;&#972;&#957;</span>) and
judicial (<span class="grk" title="dikanikon">&#948;&#953;&#954;&#945;&#957;&#953;&#954;&#972;&#957;</span>); whereas his rival Isocrates had considered
that laudation and vituperation, which Aristotle elevated
into species of declamation, run through every kind (Quintilian
iv. 4), and Anaximenes recognized only the deliberative and the
judicial (Dionys. H. <i>de Isaeo</i>, 19). In order, however, to impute
the whole work to Anaximenes, Spengel took one of the most
inexcusable steps ever taken in the history of scholarship. Without
any manuscript authority he altered the very first words
&ldquo;three genera&rdquo; (<span class="grk" title="tria genae">&#964;&#961;&#943;&#945; &#947;&#941;&#957;&#951;</span>) into &ldquo;two genera&rdquo; (<span class="grk" title="duo genae">&#948;&#973;&#959; &#947;&#941;&#957;&#951;</span>), and
omitted the words &ldquo;one declamatory&rdquo; (<span class="grk" title="to de epideiktikon">&#964;&#8056; &#948;&#8050; &#7952;&#960;&#953;&#948;&#949;&#953;&#954;&#964;&#953;&#954;&#972;&#957;</span>).
Quintilian (iii. 4) imputes to Anaximenes two genera, deliberative
and judicial, and seven species, &ldquo;hortandi, dehortandi, laudandi,
vituperandi, accusandi, defendendi, exquirendi, quod <span class="grk" title="exetastikon">&#7952;&#958;&#949;&#964;&#945;&#963;&#964;&#953;&#954;&#8056;&#957;</span>
dicit.&rdquo; But the author of this rhetoric most certainly recognized
three genera (<span class="grk" title="tria genae">&#964;&#961;&#943;&#945; &#947;&#941;&#957;&#951;</span>), since, besides the deliberative and
judicial, the declamatory genus constantly appears in the work
(chaps. 2 <i>init.</i>, 4, 7, 18, 36, cf. <span class="grk" title="oyk agonos all epideixeos eneka">&#959;&#8016;&#954; &#7936;&#947;&#8182;&#957;&#959;&#962; &#7936;&#955;&#955;&#8125; &#7952;&#960;&#953;&#948;&#949;&#943;&#958;&#949;&#969;&#962; &#7955;&#957;&#949;&#954;&#945;</span>
1440 <i>b</i> 13); and, if the terms for it are not always the same, this is
just what one would expect in a new discovery. Moreover, he
could recognize seven species in the <i>Rhetoric to Alexander</i>, though
he recognized only six in the <i>Rhetoric</i>, provided the two works
were not written at the same time; and as a matter of fact
even in the <i>Rhetoric to Alexander</i> the seventh or critical species
(<span class="grk" title="exetastikon">&#7952;&#958;&#949;&#964;&#945;&#963;&#964;&#953;&#954;&#972;&#957;</span>) is in process of disappearing (cf. chap. 37). As
then Anaximenes did not, but Aristotle did, recognize three
genera, and as Aristotle could as well as Anaximenes recognize
seven species, the evidence is overwhelming that the <i>Rhetoric to
Alexander</i> is the work not of Anaximenes, but of Aristotle; on
the condition that its date is not that of Aristotle&rsquo;s confessedly
genuine <i>Rhetoric</i>.</p>

<p>There is a second and even stronger evidence that the <i>Rhetoric
to Alexander</i> is a genuine work of Aristotle. It divides (chap. 8)
evidences (<span class="grk" title="pisteis">&#960;&#943;&#963;&#964;&#949;&#953;&#962;</span>) into two kinds (1) evidence from arguments,
actions and men (<span class="grk" title="ai men ex auton ton logon kai ton praxeon kai
ton anthropon">&#945;&#7985; &#956;&#8050;&#957; &#7952;&#958; &#945;&#8016;&#964;&#8182;&#957; &#964;&#8182;&#957; &#955;&#972;&#947;&#969;&#957; &#954;&#945;&#8054; &#964;&#8182;&#957; &#960;&#961;&#940;&#958;&#949;&#969;&#957; &#954;&#945;&#8054; &#964;&#8182;&#957; &#7936;&#957;&#952;&#961;&#974;&#960;&#969;&#957;</span>); (2) adventitious evidences (<span class="grk" title="ai d&rsquo; epithetoi tois
legomenois kai tois prattomenois">&#945;&#7985; &#948;&#8125; &#7952;&#960;&#943;&#952;&#949;&#964;&#959;&#953; &#964;&#959;&#8150;&#962; &#955;&#949;&#947;&#959;&#956;&#941;&#957;&#959;&#953;&#962; &#954;&#945;&#8054; &#964;&#959;&#8150;&#962; &#960;&#961;&#945;&#964;&#964;&#959;&#956;&#941;&#957;&#959;&#953;&#962;</span>). The former are immediately
enumerated as probabilities (<span class="grk" title="eikota">&#949;&#7984;&#954;&#972;&#964;&#945;</span>), examples (<span class="grk" title="paradeigmara">&#960;&#945;&#961;&#945;&#948;&#949;&#943;&#947;&#956;&#945;&#964;&#945;</span>),
proofs (<span class="grk" title="tekmaeria">&#964;&#949;&#954;&#956;&#942;&#961;&#953;&#945;</span>), considerations (<span class="grk" title="enthomaemata">&#7952;&#957;&#952;&#965;&#956;&#942;&#956;&#945;&#964;&#945;</span>), maxims (<span class="grk" title="gnomai">&#947;&#957;&#8182;&#956;&#945;&#953;</span>),
signs (<span class="grk" title="saemeia">&#963;&#951;&#956;&#949;&#8150;&#945;</span>), refutations (<span class="grk" title="elenchoi">&#7956;&#955;&#949;&#947;&#967;&#959;&#953;</span>); the latter as opinion of
the speaker (<span class="grk" title="doxa ton legontos">&#948;&#972;&#958;&#945; &#964;&#959;&#8166; &#955;&#949;&#947;&#959;&#957;&#964;&#959;&#962;</span>), witnesses (<span class="grk" title="martyriai">&#956;&#945;&#961;&#964;&#965;&#961;&#943;&#945;&#953;</span>), tortures
(<span class="grk" title="basanoi">&#946;&#940;&#963;&#945;&#957;&#959;&#953;</span>), oaths (<span class="grk" title="orkoi">&#8004;&#961;&#954;&#959;&#953;</span>). It is confessed by Spengel himself
that these two kinds of evidences are the two kinds recognized
in Aristotle&rsquo;s <i>Rhetoric</i> as (1) artificial (<span class="grk" title="entechnoi pisteis">&#7952;&#957;&#964;&#941;&#967;&#957;&#959;&#953; &#960;&#943;&#963;&#964;&#949;&#953;&#962;</span>) and
(2) inartificial (<span class="grk" title="atechnoi pisteis">&#7936;&#964;&#941;&#967;&#957;&#959;&#953; &#960;&#943;&#963;&#964;&#949;&#953;&#962;</span>). Now, from the outset of his
<i>Rhetoric</i> Aristotle himself claims to be the first to distinguish
between artificial evidences from arguments and other evidences
which he regards as mere additions; and he complains that the
composers of arts of speaking had neglected the former for the
latter. In particular, rhetoricians appeared to him to have
neglected argument in comparison with passion. No doubt,
rational evidences had appeared in books of rhetoric, as we see
from Plato&rsquo;s <i>Phaedrus</i>, 266-267,where we find proofs, probabilities,
refutation and maxim, but mixed up with other evidences. The
point of Aristotle was to draw a line between rational and other
evidences, to insist on the former, and in fact to found a logic of
rhetoric. But if in the <i>Rhetoric to Alexander</i>, not he, but Anaximenes,
had already performed this great achievement, Aristotle
would have been the meanest of mankind; for the logic of
rhetoric would have been really the work of Anaximenes the
sophist, but falsely claimed by Aristotle the philosopher. As we
cannot without a tittle of evidence accept such a consequence,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page516" id="page516"></a>516</span>
we conclude that Aristotle formulated the distinction between
argumentative and adventitious, artificial and inartificial evidences,
both in the <i>Rhetoric to Alexander</i> and in the <i>Rhetoric</i>;
and that the former as well as the latter is a genuine work of
Aristotle, the founder of the logic of rhetoric.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>What is the relation between these two genuine Rhetorics? The
last event mentioned in the <i>Rhetoric to Alexander</i> occurred in 340,
the last in the <i>Rhetoric</i> is the common peace (<span class="grk" title="koinae eiraenae">&#954;&#959;&#953;&#957;&#8052; &#949;&#7984;&#961;&#7968;&#957;&#951;</span>) made
between Alexander and the Greeks in 336 (<i>Rhet</i>. ii. 23, 1399 b 12).
The former treatise (chap. 9), under the head of examples
(<span class="grk" title="paradeigmata">&#960;&#945;&#961;&#945;&#948;&#949;&#943;&#947;&#956;&#945;&#964;&#945;</span>), gives historical examples of the unexpected in war
for the years 403, 371, 358, concluding with the year 340, in which
the Corinthians, coming with nine triremes to the assistance of
the Syracusans, defeated the Carthaginians who were blockading
Syracuse with 150 ships. Spengel, indeed, tries to bring the latest
date in the book down to 330; but it is by absurdly supposing that
the author could not have got the commonplace, &ldquo;one ought to
criticize not bitterly but gently,&rdquo; except from Demosthenes, <i>De
Corona</i> (§ 265). We may take it then that the last date in the
<i>Rhetoric to Alexander</i> is 340; and by a curious coincidence 340 was
the year when, on Philip&rsquo;s marching against Byzantium, Alexander
was left behind as regent and keeper of the seal, and distinguished
himself so greatly that Philip was only too glad that the Macedonians
called Alexander king (Plutarch, <i>Alexander</i>, 9). It is possible then
that Aristotle may have written the dedication to Alexander about
340 and treated him as if he were king in the dedicatory epistle.
At the same time, as such prefaces are often forgeries, not prejudicing
the body of the treatise, it does not really matter whether
Aristotle actually dedicated his work to Alexander in that epistle
about that year or not. If he did, then the <i>Rhetoric to Alexander</i> in
340 was at least four years prior to the <i>Rhetoric</i>, which was as late as
336. If he did not, the question still remains, what is the internal
relation between these two genuine Rhetorics? It will turn out
most important.</p>

<p>The relation between the two Rhetorics turns on their treatment
of rational, argumentative, artificial evidences. Each of them, the
probability (chap. 8), the example (chap. 9), the proof (chap. 10), the
consideration (chap, 11), the maxim (chap. 12), the sign (chap. 13),
the refutation (chap. 14), though very like what it is in the <i>Rhetoric</i>,
receives in the <i>Rhetoric to Alexander</i> a definition slightly different
from the definition in the <i>Rhetoric</i>, which it must be remembered is
also the definition in the <i>Prior Analytics</i>. Strange as this point is, it
is still stranger that not one of these internal evidences is brought
into relation with induction and deduction. Example (<span class="grk" title="paradeigma">&#960;&#945;&#961;&#940;&#948;&#949;&#953;&#947;&#956;&#945;</span>)
is not called rhetorical induction, and consideration (<span class="grk" title="enthymaema">&#7952;&#957;&#952;&#973;&#956;&#951;&#956;&#945;</span>) is
not called rhetorical syllogism, as they are in the <i>Rhetoric</i>, and in
the <i>Analytics</i>. Induction (<span class="grk" title="epagogae">&#7952;&#960;&#945;&#947;&#969;&#947;&#942;</span>) and syllogism (<span class="grk" title="syllogismos">&#963;&#965;&#955;&#955;&#959;&#947;&#953;&#963;&#956;&#972;&#962;</span>), the
general forms of inference, do not occur in the <i>Rhetoric to Alexander</i>.
In fact, this interesting treatise contains a rudimentary treatment of
rational evidences in rhetoric and is therefore earlier than the
<i>Rhetoric</i>, which exhibits a developed analysis of these rational
evidences as special logical forms. Together, the earlier and the later
<i>Rhetoric</i> show us the logic of rhetoric in the making, going on about
340, the last date of the <i>Rhetoric to Alexander</i>, and more developed
in or after 336 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>, the last date of the <i>Rhetoric</i>.</p>

<p>Nor is this all: the earlier <i>Rhetoric to Alexander</i> and the later
<i>Rhetoric</i> show us logic itself in the making. We have already said
that Aristotle was primarily a metaphysician. He gradually became
a logician out of his previous studies: out of metaphysics, for with
him being is always the basis of thinking, and common principles,
such as that of contradiction, are axioms of things before axioms of
thought, while categories are primarily things signified by names;
out of the mathematics of the Pythagoreans and the Platonists,
which taught him the nature of demonstration; out of the physics,
of which he imbibed the first draughts from his father, which taught
him induction from sense and the modification of strict demonstration
to suit facts; out of the dialectic between man and man which
provided him with beautiful examples of inference in the Socratic
dialogues of Xenophon and Plato; out of the rhetoric addressed to
large audiences, which with dialectic called his attention to probable
inferences; out of the grammar taught with rhetoric and poetics
which led him to the logic of the proposition. We cannot write a
history of the varied origin of logic, beyond putting the rudimentary
logic of the proposition in the <i>De Interpretatione</i> before the less
rudimentary theory of categories as significant names capable of
becoming predicates in the <i>Categories</i>, and before the maturer analysis
of the syllogism in the <i>Analytics</i>. But at any rate the process was
gradual; and Aristotle was advanced in metaphysics, mathematics,
physics, dialectics, rhetoric and poetics, before he became the founder
of logic.</p>
</div>

<p class="pt2 center sc">V. Order of the Philosophical Writings</p>

<p>Some of Aristotle&rsquo;s philosophical writings then are earlier than
others; because they show more Platonic influence, and are
more rudimentary; <i>e.g.</i> the <i>Categories</i> earlier than some parts of
the <i>Metaphysics</i>, because under the influence of Platonic forms
it talks of inherent attributes, and allows secondary substances
which are universal; the <i>De Interpretatione</i> earlier than the
<i>Analytics</i>, because in it the Platonic analysis of the sentence into
noun and verb is retained for the proposition; the <i>Eudemian
Ethics</i> and the <i>Magna Moralia</i> earlier than the <i>Nicomachean
Ethics</i>, because they are rudimentary sketches of it, and the one
written rather in the theological spirit, the other rather in the
dialectical style, of Plato; and the <i>Rhetoric to Alexander</i> earlier
than the <i>Rhetoric</i>, because it contains a rudimentary theory of
the rational evidences afterwards developed into a logic of
rhetoric in the <i>Rhetoric</i> and <i>Analytics</i>.</p>

<p>It is tempting to think that we can carry out the chronological
order of the philosophical writings in detail. But in the gradual
process of composition, by which a work once begun was kept
going with the rest, although a work such as the <i>Politics</i> (begun
in 357) was begun early, and some works more rudimentary came
earlier than others, the general body of writings was so kept
together in Aristotle&rsquo;s library, and so simultaneously elaborated
and consolidated into a system that it soon becomes impossible
to put one before another.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>Zeller, indeed, has attempted an exact order of succession:&mdash;</p>

<div class="list">
  <p>1. The logical treatises.</p>
  <p>2. The <i>Physics, De Coelo, De Generatione et Corruptione, Meteorologica</i>.</p>
  <p>3. <i>Historia Animalium, De Anima, Parva Naturalia, De Partibus Animalium,
       De Animalium Incessu, De Generatione Animalium</i>.</p>
  <p>4. <i>Ethics</i> and <i>Politics</i>.</p>
  <p>5. <i>Poetics</i> and <i>Rhetoric</i>.</p>
  <p>6. <i>Metaphysics</i> (unfinished).</p>
</div>

<p>But Zeller does not give enough weight either to the evidence of
early composition contained in the <i>Politics</i> and <i>Meteorology</i>, or to the
evidence of subsequent contemporaneous composition contained in
the cross-references, <i>e.g.</i> between the <i>Physics</i> and the <i>Metaphysics</i>.
On the other hand he gives too much weight to the references from
one book to another, which Aristotle could have entered into his
manuscripts at any time before his death. Moreover, the arrangement
sometimes breaks down: for example, though on the whole
the logical books are quoted without quoting the rest, the <i>De Interpretatione</i>
(chap. 1) quotes the <i>De Anima</i>, and therefore is falsely taken
by Zeller against its own internal evidence to be subsequent to it and
consequently to the other logical books. Again, the <i>Meteorologica</i>
(iii. 2, 372 b 9) quotes the <i>De Sensu</i> (c. 3), and therefore, on Zeller&rsquo;s
arguments, ought to follow one of the <i>Parva Naturalia</i>. Lastly,
though the <i>Metaphysics</i> often quotes the <i>Physics</i>, and is therefore
regarded as being subsequent, it is itself quoted in the <i>Physics</i> (i. 8,
191 b 29), and therefore ought to be regarded as antecedent. Zeller
tries to get over this difficulty of cross-reference by detaching <i>Metaphysics</i>,
Book &Delta;, from the rest and placing it before the <i>Physics</i>.
But this violent and arbitrary remedy is only partial. The truth is
that the <i>Metaphysics</i> both precedes and follows the <i>Physics</i>, because
it had been all along occupying Aristotle ever since he began to
differ from Plato&rsquo;s metaphysical views and indeed forms a kind of
presupposed basis of his whole system. So generally, the references
backwards and forwards, and the cross-references, are really evidences
that Aristotle mainly wrote his works not successively but
simultaneously, and entered references as and when he pleased, because
he had not published them.</p>

<p>There are two kinds of quotations in Aristotle&rsquo;s extant works, the
quotation of another book, and the quotation of a historical fact.
While the former is useless to determine the sequence of books written
simultaneously, the latter is insufficient to determine a complete
chronological order. When Aristotle, <i>e.g.</i> in the <i>Politics</i>, quotes an
event as now (<span class="grk" title="nun">&#957;&#8166;&#957;</span>), he was writing about it at that time; and when
he quotes another event as lately (<span class="grk" title="neosti">&#957;&#949;&#969;&#963;&#964;&#943;</span>) he was writing about it
shortly after that time; but he might have been writing the rest of
the <i>Politics</i> both before and after either event. When he quotes the
last event mentioned in the book, <i>e.g.</i> in the <i>Rhetoric</i> (ii. 23, 1399 b
12) the &ldquo;common peace&rdquo; of Greece under Alexander in 336, he was
writing as late as that date, but he might also have been writing the
<i>Rhetoric</i> both before it and after it. When he quotes what persons
used to say in the past, <i>e.g.</i> Plato and Speusippus in the <i>Ethics</i>,
Eudoxus and Callippus in the <i>Metaphysics</i>, he was writing these
passages after the deaths of these persons; but he might have been
also writing the <i>Ethics</i> and the <i>Metaphysics</i> both beforehand and
afterwards. Lastly, when he is silent about a historical fact, the
argument from silence is evidence only when he could not have failed
to mention it; as, for example, in the <i>Constitution of Athens</i>, when
he could not have failed to mention quinqueremes and other facts
after 325-324. But this is in a historical work; whereas the argument
from silence about historical facts in a philosophical work can
seldom apply.</p>

<p>The chronological order therefore is not sufficiently detailed to
be the real order of Aristotelian writings. Secondly, the traditional
order, which for nearly 2000 years has descended from the edition
of Andronicus to the Berlin edition, is satisfactory in details, but
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page517" id="page517"></a>517</span>
unsatisfactory in system. It gives too much weight to Aristotle&rsquo;s
logic, and too little to his metaphysics, on account of two prejudices
of the commentators which led them to place both logic and physics
before metaphysics. Aristotle rightly used all the sciences of his day,
and especially his own physics, as a basis of his metaphysics. For
example, at the very outset he refers to the <i>Physics</i> (ii. 2)for his use
of the four causes, material, efficient, formal and final, in the <i>Metaphysics</i>
(&Alpha; 2). This and other applications of the science of nature to
the science of all being induced the commentators to adopt this order,
and entitle the science of being the <i>Sequel to the Physics</i> (<span class="grk" title="ta meta ta physica">&#964;&#8048; &#956;&#949;&#964;&#8048; &#964;&#8048; &#966;&#965;&#963;&#953;&#954;&#940;</span>).
But Aristotle knew nothing of this title, the first known
use of which was by Nicolaus Damascenus, a younger contemporary
of Andronicus, the editor of the Aristotelian writings, and Andronicus
was probably the originator of the title, and of the order. On the
other hand, Aristotle entitles the science of all being &ldquo;Primary
Philosophy&rdquo; (<span class="grk" title="protae philosophia">&#960;&#961;&#974;&#964;&#951; &#966;&#953;&#955;&#959;&#963;&#959;&#966;&#943;&#945;</span>), and the science of physical being
&ldquo;Secondary Philosophy&rdquo; (<span class="grk" title="deutera philosophia">&#948;&#949;&#973;&#964;&#949;&#961;&#945; &#966;&#953;&#955;&#959;&#963;&#959;&#966;&#943;&#945;</span>), which suggests that
his order is from Metaphysics to Physics, the reverse of his editor&rsquo;s
order from Physics to Metaphysics. Thus the traditional order puts
Physics before Metaphysics without Aristotle&rsquo;s authority. With
some more show of authority it puts Logic before Metaphysics.
Aristotle, on introducing the principle of contradiction (<i>Met.</i> &Gamma; 3),
which belongs to Metaphysics as an axiom of being, says that those
who attempt to discuss the question of accepting this axiom, do so on
account of their ignorance of <i>Analytics</i>, which they ought to know
beforehand (<span class="grk" title="proepistamenous">&#960;&#961;&#959;&#949;&#960;&#953;&#963;&#964;&#945;&#956;&#941;&#957;&#959;&#965;&#962;</span>). He means that the logical analysis
of demonstration in the <i>Analytics</i> would teach them beforehand that
there cannot be demonstration, though there must be induction, of an
axiom, or any other principle; whereas, if they are not logically prepared
for metaphysics, they will expect a demonstration of the axiom,
as Heraclitus, the Heraclitean Cratylus and the Sophist Protagoras
actually did,&mdash;and in vain. Acting on this hint, not Aristotle but the
Peripatetics inferred that all logic is an instrument (<span class="grk" title="organon">&#8004;&#961;&#947;&#945;&#957;&#959;&#957;</span>) of all
sciences; and by the time of Andronicus, who was one of them and
sometimes called &ldquo;the eleventh from Aristotle,&rdquo; the order, Logic-Physics-Metaphysics,
had become established pretty much as we have
it now. It is, however, not the real order for studying the philosophy
of Aristotle, because there is more Metaphysics in his Physics than
Physics in his Metaphysics, and more Metaphysics in his Logic than
Logic in his Metaphysics. The commentators themselves were doubtful
about the order: Boethus proposed to begin with Physics, and some
of the Platonists with Ethics or Mathematics; while Andronicus preferred
to put Logic first as Organon (<i>Scholia</i>, 25 b 34 seq.). None of
the parties to the dispute had the authority of Aristotle. What do we
find in his works? Primary philosophy, Metaphysics, the science of
being, is the solid foundation of all parts of his philosophical system;
not only in the <i>Physics</i>, but also in the <i>De Coelo</i> (i. 8, 277 b 10), in the
<i>De Generatione</i> (i. 3, 318 a 6; ii. 10, 336 b 29), in the <i>De Anima</i> (i. 1,
403 a 28, cf. b 16), in the <i>De Partibus Animalium</i> (i. 1, 641 a 35), in the
<i>Nicomachean Ethics</i> (i. 6, 1096 b 30), in the <i>De Interpretatione</i> (5, 17 a
14); and in short throughout his extant works. The reason is that
Aristotle was primarily a metaphysician half for and half against
Plato, occupied himself with metaphysics all his philosophical
life, made the science of things the universal basis of all sciences
without destroying their independence, and so gradually brought
round philosophy from universal forms to individual substances.
The traditional order of the Aristotelian writings, still continued in
the Berlin edition, beginning with the logical writings on page 1,
proceeding to the physical writings on page 184, and postponing
the Metaphysics to page 980, is not the real order of Aristotle&rsquo;s
philosophy.</p>
</div>

<p>The real order of Aristotle&rsquo;s philosophy is that of Aristotle&rsquo;s
mind, revealed in his writings, and by the general view of thinking,
science, philosophy and all learning therein contained. He
classified thinking (<i>Met.</i> &Epsilon; 1) and science (<i>Topics</i>, vi. 6) by the
three operations of speculation (<span class="grk" title="theoria">&#952;&#949;&#969;&#961;&#943;&#945;</span>), practice (<span class="grk" title="praxis">&#960;&#961;&#8118;&#958;&#953;&#962;</span>) and
production (<span class="grk" title="poiaesis">&#960;&#959;&#943;&#951;&#963;&#953;&#962;</span>), and made the following subdivisions:&mdash;</p>

<p class="in">I. Speculative: about things; subdivided (<i>Met.</i> &Epsilon; 1; <i>De An.</i> i. 1) into:&mdash;</p>
<div class="list">
    <p>i. Primary Philosophy, Theology, also called Wisdom, about things as things.</p>
    <p>ii. Mathematical Philosophy, about quantitative things in the abstract.</p>
    <p>iii. Physical Philosophy, about things as changing, and therefore about natural substances or bodies, composed of matter and essence.</p>
</div>
<p class="in">II. Practical or Political Philosophy, or philosophy of things human (cf. <i>E.N.</i> x. 9-fin.): about human good; subdivided (<i>E.N.</i> vi. 8, cf. <i>E.E.</i> &Alpha; 8, 1218 b 13) into:&mdash;</p>
<div class="list">
    <p>i. Ethics, about the good of the individual.</p>
    <p>ii. Economics, about the good of the family.</p>
    <p>iii. Politics, about the general good of the state.</p>
</div>
<p class="in">III. Productive, or Art (<span class="grk" title="technae">&#964;&#941;&#967;&#957;&#951;</span>): about works produced; subdivided (<i>Met.</i> &Alpha;. 1, 981 b 17-20) into:&mdash;</p>
<div class="list">
    <p>i. Necessary (<span class="grk" title="pros tanagkaia">&#960;&#961;&#8056;&#962; &#964;&#940;&#957;&#945;&#947;&#954;&#945;&#8150;&#945;</span>), <i>e.g.</i> medicine.</p>
    <p>ii. Fine (<span class="grk" title="pros diagogaen">&#960;&#961;&#8056;&#946; &#948;&#953;&#945;&#947;&#969;&#947;&#942;&#957;</span>), <i>e.g.</i> poetry.</p>
</div>

<p>Aristotle calls all these investigations sciences (<span class="grk" title="epistaemai">&#7952;&#960;&#953;&#963;&#964;&#8134;&#956;&#945;&#953;</span>):
but he also uses the term &ldquo;sciences&rdquo; in a narrower sense in
consequence of a classification of their objects, which pervades his
writings, into things necessary and things contingent, as follows.&mdash;</p>

<p class="in">(A) The necessary (<span class="grk" title="to mae endechomenon allos echein">&#964;&#8056; &#956;&#8052; &#7952;&#957;&#948;&#949;&#967;&#972;&#956;&#949;&#957;&#959;&#957; &#7940;&#955;&#955;&#969;&#962; &#7956;&#967;&#949;&#953;&#957;</span>), what must be; subdivided into:&mdash;</p>
<div class="list">
    <p>(1) Absolutely (<span class="grk" title="haplos">&#7937;&#960;&#955;&#8182;&#962;</span>), <i>e.g.</i> the mathematical.</p>
    <p>(2) Hypothetically (<span class="grk" title="ex hypotheseus">&#7952;&#958; &#8017;&#960;&#959;&#952;&#941;&#963;&#949;&#969;&#962;</span>), <i>e.g.</i> matter necessary as means to an end.</p>
</div>
<p class="in">(B) The contingent (<span class="grk" title="to endechomenon allos echein">&#964;&#8056; &#7952;&#957;&#948;&#949;&#967;&#972;&#956;&#949;&#957;&#959;&#957; &#7940;&#955;&#955;&#969;&#962; &#7956;&#967;&#949;&#953;&#957;</span>), what may
         be; subdivided into:&mdash;</p>
<div class="list">
    <p>(1) The usual (<span class="grk" title="to hos epi to polu">&#964;&#8056; &#8033;&#962; &#7952;&#960;&#8054; &#964;&#8056; &#960;&#959;&#955;&#973;</span>) or natural (<span class="grk" title="to physikon">&#964;&#8056; &#966;&#965;&#963;&#953;&#954;&#972;&#957;</span>), <i>e.g.</i> a man grows grey.</p>
    <p>(2) The accidental (<span class="grk" title="to kata symbebaekos">&#964;&#8056; &#954;&#945;&#964;&#8048; &#963;&#965;&#956;&#946;&#949;&#946;&#951;&#954;&#972;&#962;</span>), <i>e.g.</i> a man sits or not.</p>
</div>

<p>Now, according to Aristotle, science in the narrow sense is
concerned only with the absolutely necessary (<i>E.N.</i> iii. 3), and in
the classification would stop at mathematics, which we still call
exact science: in the wide sense, on the other hand, it extends
to the whole of the necessary and to the usual contingent, but
excludes the accidental (<i>Met.</i> &Epsilon; 2), and would in the classification
include not only metaphysics and mathematics, but also physics,
ethics, economics, politics, necessary and fine art; or in short
all speculative, practical and productive thinking of a systematic
kind. Hence the <i>Posterior Analytics</i>, which is Aristotle&rsquo;s
authoritative logic of science, is of peculiar interest because, after
beginning by defining science as investigating necessary objects
from necessary principles (i. 4), it proceeds to say that it is either
of the necessary or of the usual though not of the accidental
(i. 29), and to admit that its principles are some necessary and
some contingent (i. 32, 88 b 7). Philosophy (<span class="grk" title="philosophia">&#966;&#953;&#955;&#959;&#962;&#959;&#966;&#943;&#945;</span>) also is
used by him in a similar manner. Though occasionally he means
by it primary philosophy (<i>Met.</i> &Gamma; 2-3, &Kappa; 3), more frequently he
extends it to all three speculative philosophies (&Epsilon; 1, 1026 a 18,
<span class="grk" title="treis an eien philosophiai theoraetikai, mathaematikae, physikae, theologikae">&#964;&#961;&#949;&#8150;&#962; &#7938;&#957; &#949;&#7990;&#949;&#957; &#966;&#953;&#955;&#959;&#963;&#959;&#966;&#943;&#945;&#953; &#952;&#949;&#969;&#961;&#951;&#964;&#953;&#954;&#945;&#943;, &#956;&#945;&#952;&#951;&#956;&#945;&#964;&#953;&#954;&#942;, &#966;&#965;&#963;&#953;&#954;&#942;, &#952;&#949;&#959;&#955;&#959;&#947;&#953;&#954;&#942;</span>),
and to all three practical philosophies, as we see from
the constant use of the phrase &ldquo;political philosopher&rdquo; in the
<i>Ethics</i>; and in short applies it to all sciences except productive
science or art. With him, as with the Greeks generally, the
problems of philosophy are the nature and origin of being and of
good: it is not as with too many of us a mere science of mind.</p>

<p>Aristotle&rsquo;s view of thinking in science and philosophy is essentially
comprehensive; but it is not so wide as to become indefinite.
According to him, science at its widest selects a special subject,
<i>e.g.</i> number in arithmetic, magnitude in geometry, stars in
astronomy, a man&rsquo;s good in ethics; concentrates itself on the
causes and appropriate principles of its subject, especially the
definition of the subject and its species by their essences or formal
causes; and after an inductive intelligence of those principles
proceeds by a deductive demonstration from definitions to
consequences: philosophy is simply a desire of this definite
knowledge of causes and effects. Beyond philosophy, not
beyond science, there is art; and beyond philosophy and science
there is history, the description of facts preparatory to philosophy,
the investigation of causes (cf. <i>Pr. An.</i> i. 30); and this may
be natural history, preparatory to natural philosophy, as in the
<i>History of Animals</i> preparatory to the <i>De Partibus Animalium</i>,
or what we call civil history, preparatory to political philosophy,
as in the 158 Constitutions more or less preparatory to the
<i>Politics</i>.</p>

<p>Wide as is all his knowledge of facts and causes, it does not
appear to Aristotle to be the whole of learning and the show of it.
Beyond knowledge lies opinion, beyond discovery disputation,
beyond philosophy and science dialectic between man and man,
which was much practised by the Greeks in the dialogues of
Socrates, Plato, the Megarians and Aristotle himself in his early
manhood. With Plato, who thought that the interrogation of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page518" id="page518"></a>518</span>
man is the best instrument of truth, dialectic was exaggerated
into a universal science of everything that is. Aristotle, on
the other hand, learnt to distinguish dialectic (<span class="grk" title="dialektikae">&#948;&#953;&#945;&#955;&#949;&#954;&#964;&#953;&#954;&#942;</span>) from
science (<span class="grk" title="epotaemae">&#7952;&#960;&#953;&#963;&#964;&#942;&#956;&#951;</span>); in that it has no definite subject, else it
would not ask questions (<i>Post. An.</i> i. 11, 77 a 31-33); in that for
appropriate principles it substitutes the probabilities of authority
(<span class="grk" title="ta hendoxa">&#964;&#8048; &#7956;&#957;&#948;&#959;&#958;&#945;</span>) which are the opinions of all, or of the majority, or of
the wise (<i>Top.</i> i. 1, 100 b 21-23); and in that it is not like science a
deduction from true and primary principles of a definite subject
to true consequences, but a deduction from opinion to opinion,
which may be true or false. Sophistry appeared to him to be like
it, except that it is a fallacious deduction either from merely
apparent probabilities in its matter or itself merely apparently
syllogistic in its form (cf. <i>Topics</i>, i. 1). Moreover, he compared
dialectic and sophistry, on account of their generality, with
primary philosophy in the <i>Metaphysics</i> (&Gamma; 2, 1004 b 17-26); to
the effect that all three concern themselves with all things,
but that about everything metaphysics is scientific, dialectic
tentative, sophistry apparent, not real. He means that a sophist
like Protagoras will teach superficially anything as wisdom for
money; and that even a dialectician like Plato will write a
dialogue, such as the <i>Republic</i>, nominally about justice, but really
about all things from the generality of the form of good, instead
of from appropriate moral principles; but that a primary philosopher
selects as a definite subject all things as such without
interfering with the special sciences of different things each in
its kind (<i>Met.</i> &Gamma; 1), and investigates the axioms or common
principles of things as things (<i>ib.</i> 3), without pretending, like
Plato, to deduce from any common principle the special principles
of each science (<i>Post. An.</i> i. 9, 32). Aristotle at once maintains
the primacy of metaphysics and vindicates the independence of
the special sciences. He is at the same time the only Greek
philosopher who clearly discriminated discovery and disputation,
science and dialectic, the knowledge of a definite subject from its
appropriate principles and the discussion of anything whatever
from opinions and authority. On one side he places science and
philosophy, on the other dialectic and sophistry.</p>

<p>Such is the great mind of Aristotle manifested in the large map
of learning, by which we have now to determine the order of his
extant philosophical writings, with a view to studying them in
their real order, which is neither chronological nor traditional,
but philosophical and scientific. Turning over the pages of the
Berlin edition, but passing over works which are perhaps spurious,
we should put first and foremost speculative philosophy, and
therein the primary philosophy of his <i>Metaphysics</i> (980 a 21-1093
b 29); then the secondary philosophy of his <i>Physics</i>,
followed by his other physical works, general and biological,
including among the latter the <i>Historia Animalium</i> as preparatory
to the <i>De Partibus Animalium</i>, and the <i>De Anima</i> and <i>Parva
Naturalia</i>, which he called &ldquo;physical&rdquo; but we call &ldquo;psychological&rdquo;
(184 a 10-967 b 27); next, the practical philosophy of the
<i>Ethics</i>, including the <i>Eudemian Ethics</i> and the <i>Magna Moralia</i>
as earlier and the <i>Nicomachean Ethics</i> as later (1094-1249 b 25),
and of the <i>Politics</i> (1252-1342), with the addition of the newly
discovered <i>Athenian Constitution</i> as ancillary to it; finally, the
productive science, or art, of the <i>Rhetoric</i>, including the earlier
<i>Rhetoric to Alexander</i> and the later <i>Rhetorical Art</i>, and of the
<i>Poetics</i>, which was unfinished (1354-end). This is the real order
of Aristotle&rsquo;s system, based on his own theory and classification
of sciences.</p>

<p>But what has become of Logic, with which the traditional
order of Andronicus begins Aristotle&rsquo;s works (1-148 b 8)? So far
from coming first, Logic comes nowhere in his classification of
science. Aristotle was the founder of Logic; because, though
others, and especially Plato, had made occasional remarks about
reason (<span class="grk" title="logos">&#955;&#972;&#947;&#959;&#962;</span>), Aristotle was the first to conceive it as a definite
subject of investigation. As he says at the end of the <i>Sophistical
Elenchi</i> on the syllogism, he had no predecessor, but took pains
and laboured a long time in investigating it. Nobody, not even
Plato, had discovered that the process of deduction is a combination
of premisses (<span class="grk" title="syllogomos">&#963;&#965;&#955;&#955;&#959;&#947;&#953;&#963;&#956;&#972;&#962;</span>) to produce a new conclusion.
Aristotle, who made this great discovery, must have had great
difficulty in developing the new investigation of reasoning processes
out of dialectic, rhetoric, poetics, grammar, metaphysics,
mathematics, physics and ethics; and in disengaging it from
other kinds of learning. He got so far as gradually to write short
discourses and long treatises, which we, not he, now arrange in
the order of the <i>Categories</i> or names; the <i>De Interpretatione</i>
on propositions; the <i>Analytics</i>, <i>Prior</i> on syllogism, <i>Posterior</i>
on scientific syllogism; the <i>Topics</i> on dialectical syllogism; the
<i>Sophistici Elenchi</i> on eristical or sophistical syllogism; and,
except that he had hardly a logic of induction, he covered the
ground. But after all this original research he got no further.
First, he did not combine all these works into a system. He
may have laid out the sequence of syllogisms from the
<i>Analytics</i> onwards; but how about the <i>Categories</i> and the <i>De
Interpretatione</i>? Secondly, he made no division of logic. In the
<i>Categories</i> he distinguished names and propositions for the sake
of the classification of names; in the <i>De Interpretatione</i> he
distinguished nouns and verbs from sentences with a view to the
enunciative sentence: in the <i>Analytics</i> he analysed the syllogism
into premisses and premisses into terms and copula, for the
purpose of syllogism. But he never called any of these a division
of all logic. Thirdly, he had no one name for logic. In the
<i>Posterior Analytics</i> (i. 22, 84 a 7-8) he distinguishes two modes
of investigation, analytically (<span class="grk" title="analytikos">&#7936;&#957;&#945;&#955;&#965;&#964;&#953;&#954;&#8182;&#962;</span>) and logically (<span class="grk" title="logikos">&#955;&#959;&#947;&#953;&#954;&#8182;&#962;</span>).
But &ldquo;analytical&rdquo; means scientific inference from appropriate
principles, and &ldquo;logical&rdquo; means dialectical inference from general
considerations; and the former gives its name to the <i>Analytics</i>,
the latter suits the <i>Topics</i>, while neither analytic nor logic is a
name for all the works afterwards called logic. Fourthly, and
consequently, he gave no place to any science embracing the
whole of those works in his classification of science, but merely
threw out the hint that we should know analytics before
questioning the acceptance of the axioms of being (<i>Met.</i> &Gamma; 3).</p>

<p>It is a commentator&rsquo;s blunder to suppose that the founder
of logic elaborated it into a system, and then applied it to the
sciences. He really left the Peripatetics to combine his scattered
discourses and treatises into a system, to call it logic, and logic
<i>Organon</i>, and to put it first as the instrument of sciences; and
it was the Stoics who first called logic a science, and assigned it
the first place in their triple classification of science into logic,
physics, ethics. Would Aristotle have consented? Would he
not rather have given the first place to primary philosophy?</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>Dialectic was distinguished from science by Aristotle. Is logic,
then, according to him, not science but dialectic? The word logically
(<span class="grk" title="logikos">&#955;&#959;&#947;&#953;&#954;&#8182;&#962;</span>) means the same as dialectically (<span class="grk" title="dialektikos">&#948;&#953;&#945;&#955;&#949;&#954;&#964;&#953;&#954;&#8182;&#962;</span>). But
the general discussion of opinions, signified by both words, is only a
subordinate part of Aristotle&rsquo;s profound investigation of the whole
process of reasoning. The <i>Analytics</i>, the most important part, so far
from being dialectic or logic in that narrow sense, is called by him not
logic but analytic science (<span class="grk" title="analytickae elistaemae">&#7936;&#957;&#945;&#955;&#965;&#964;&#953;&#954;&#8052; &#7952;&#960;&#953;&#963;&#964;&#942;&#956;&#951;</span>, <i>Rhet.</i> i. 4, 1359 b 10; cf, 1356 b 9, 1357 a 30, b 25); and in the <i>Metaphysics</i> he evidently refers to
it as &ldquo;the science which considers demonstration and science,&rdquo; which
he distinguishes from the three speculative sciences, mathematics,
physics and primary philosophy (Met. &Kappa; 1, 1059 b 9-21). The
<i>Analytics</i> then, which from the beginning claims to deal with science,
is a science of sciences, without however forming any part of the
classification. On the other hand, it does not follow that Aristotle
would have regarded the <i>Topics</i>, which he calls &ldquo;the investigation&rdquo;
and &ldquo;the investigation of dialectic&rdquo; (<span class="grk" title="hae pralmateia">&#7969; &#960;&#961;&#945;&#947;&#956;&#945;&#964;&#949;&#943;&#945;</span>, <i>Top</i>, i. 1,
<span class="grk" title="hae pralmateia hae peri taen dialektikaen">&#7969; &#960;&#961;&#945;&#947;&#956;&#945;&#964;&#949;&#943;&#945; &#7969; &#960;&#949;&#961;&#8054; &#964;&#8052;&#957; &#948;&#953;&#945;&#955;&#949;&#954;&#964;&#953;&#954;&#942;&#957;</span>, Pr. <i>An.</i> i. 30, 46 a 30), or the <i>De Interpretatione</i>,
which he calls &ldquo;the present theory&rdquo; (<span class="grk" title="taes nun theorias">&#964;&#8134;&#962; &#957;&#8166;&#957; &#952;&#949;&#969;&#961;&#943;&#945;&#962;</span>, <i>De Int.</i>
6, 17 a 7), as science. In fact, as to the <i>Categories</i> as well as the <i>De Interpretatione</i>,
we are at a complete loss. But about the <i>Topics</i> we may
venture to make the suggestion that, as in describing consciousness
Aristotle says we perceive that we perceive, and understand that we
understand, and as he calls <i>Analytics</i> a science of sciences, so he
might have called the <i>Topics</i> a dialectical investigation of dialectic.
Now, this suggestion derives support from his own description of the
allied art of Rhetoric. &ldquo;Rhetoric is counterpart to dialectic&rdquo; is the
first sentence of the <i>Rhetoric</i>; and the reason is that both are concerned
with common objects of no definite science. Afterwards dialectic
and rhetoric are said to differ from other arts in taking either
side of a question (i. 1, 1355 a 33-35); rhetoric, since its artificial evidences
involve characters, passions and reasoning, is called a kind of
offshoot of dialectic and morals, and a copy of dialectic, because
neither is a science of anything definite, but both faculties (<span class="grk" title="dynameis">&#948;&#965;&#957;&#940;&#956;&#949;&#953;&#962;</span>)
of providing arguments (i. 2, 1356 a 33); and, since rhetorical arguments
are examples and enthymemes analysed in the <i>Analytics</i>,
rhetoric is finally regarded as a compound of analytic science and of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page519" id="page519"></a>519</span>
morals, while it is like dialectical and sophistic arguments (i. 4, 1359 b
2-17).</p>

<p>As then Aristotle himself regarded rhetoric as partly science and
partly dialectic, perhaps he would have said that his works on reasoning
are some science and others not, and that, while the investigation
of syllogism with a view to scientific syllogism in the <i>Analytics</i> is
analytic science, the investigation of dialectical syllogism, in the
<i>Topics</i>, with its abuse, eristical syllogism, in the <i>Sophistici Elenchi</i>, is
dialectic. At any rate, these miscellaneous works on reasoning have
no right to stand first in Aristotle&rsquo;s writings under any one name,
logic or <i>Organon</i>. As he neither put them together, nor on any one
definite plan, we are left to convenience; and the most convenient
place is with the psychology of the <i>De Anima</i>.</p>

<p>As for dialectic itself, it would have been represented by Aristotle&rsquo;s
early dialogues, had they not been lost except a few fragments. But
none of his extant writings is so much dialectic, like a Platonic dialogue.
They contain however many relics of dialectic. The <i>Rhetoric</i>
is declared by him to be partly dialectic. The <i>Topics</i> is at least an
investigation of dialectic, which has had an immense influence on the
method of argument. The <i>Magna Moralia</i> almost runs into dialogue.
Besides, all the extant works, though apparently didactic, are full of
dialectical matter in the way of opinions (<span class="grk" title="legomena">&#955;&#949;&#947;&#972;&#956;&#949;&#957;&#945;</span>), difficulties and
doubts (<span class="grk" title="aporaemata, aporiai">&#7936;&#960;&#959;&#961;&#942;&#956;&#945;&#964;&#945;, &#7936;&#960;&#959;&#961;&#943;&#945;&#953;</span>), solutions (<span class="grk" title="luseis">&#955;&#973;&#963;&#949;&#953;&#962;</span>), and of dialectical
style in the way of conversational expressions. It is probable also
that the &ldquo;extraneous discourses&rdquo; (<span class="grk" title="oi exoterikoi logoi">&#959;&#7985; &#7952;&#958;&#969;&#964;&#949;&#961;&#953;&#954;&#959;&#8054; &#955;&#972;&#947;&#959;&#953;</span>) sometimes
mentioned in them here mean dialectical discussions of a subject from
opinions extraneous to its nature, as opposed to scientific deduction
from its appropriate principles. From the eight passages, which refer
to the extraneous discourses, we find (1) that Platonic forms were
made by them matters of common talk (<span class="grk" title="tethrulaetai">&#964;&#949;&#952;&#961;&#973;&#955;&#951;&#964;&#945;&#953;</span>, <i>Met.</i> &Mu; 1, 1076a
28); (2) that time was made by them matter of doubts, which in this
case are Aristotle&rsquo;s own doubts (<i>Phys.</i> iv. 10, 217 b 31-218 a 30); (3)
that the discussions of Platonic forms in them and in philosophical
discourses were different (<i>E.E.</i> i. 8, 1217 b 22); (4) that the ordinary
distinction between goods of mind, body and estate is one which we
make (<span class="grk" title="diaironmetha">&#948;&#953;&#945;&#953;&#961;&#959;&#973;&#956;&#949;&#952;&#945;</span>) in them (<i>E.E.</i> ii. 1, 1218 b 34); (5) that in them
appeared the division of soul into irrational and rational, used by
Aristotle (<i>E.N.</i> i. 13, 1102 a 26), and attributed to Plato; (6) that the
distinction between action and production accepted by Aristotle appeared
in them (<i>E.N.</i> vi. 4, 1140 a 3); (7) that a distinction between
certain kinds of rule is one which we make often (<span class="grk" title="diorizometha">&#948;&#953;&#959;&#961;&#953;&#950;&#972;&#956;&#949;&#952;&#945;</span> ...
<span class="grk" title="pollakis">&#960;&#959;&#955;&#955;&#940;&#954;&#953;&#962;</span>) in them (<i>Pol.</i> 16, 1278 b 31); (8) that a discussion about
the best life, used by Aristotle, was made in them (<i>Pol.</i> &Eta; 1, 1323 a
22). On the whole, the interpretation which best suits all the passages
is that extraneous discourses mean any extra-scientific dialectical
discussions, oral or written, occurring in dialogues by Plato, or
by Aristotle, or by anybody else, or in ordinary conversation, on any
subject under the sun.</p>

<p>Among all the eight passages mentioned above, the most valuable
is that from the <i>Eudemian Ethics</i> (&Alpha; 8), which discriminates extraneous
discourses and philosophical (<span class="grk" title="kai en tois ezoterikois logois kai
en tois kata philosophian">&#954;&#945;&#8054; &#7952;&#957; &#964;&#959;&#8150;&#962; &#7952;&#958;&#969;&#964;&#949;&#961;&#953;&#954;&#959;&#8150;&#962; &#955;&#972;&#947;&#959;&#953;&#962; &#954;&#945;&#8054; &#7952;&#957; &#964;&#959;&#8150;&#962; &#954;&#945;&#964;&#8048; &#966;&#953;&#955;&#959;&#963;&#959;&#966;&#943;&#945;&#957;</span>, 1217 b 22-23); and it is preceded (&Alpha; 6,
1216 b 35-37 a 17), by a similar distinction between foreign discourses
(<span class="grk" title="allotrioi logoi">&#7936;&#955;&#955;&#959;&#964;&#961;&#943;&#959;&#953; &#955;&#972;&#947;&#959;&#953;</span>) and discourses appropriate to the thing (<span class="grk" title="oikeioi logoi
tou pragmatos">&#959;&#7984;&#954;&#949;&#8150;&#959;&#953; &#955;&#972;&#947;&#959;&#953; &#964;&#959;&#8166; &#960;&#961;&#940;&#947;&#956;&#945;&#964;&#959;&#962;</span>), which marks even better the opposition intended
between dialectic and philosophy. Now, as in all eight passages
Aristotle speaks, somewhat disparagingly, of &ldquo;even (<span class="grk" title="kai">&#954;&#945;&#943;</span>) extraneous
discourses,&rdquo; and as these include his own early dialogues, they must
be taken to mean that though he might quote them, he no longer
wished to be judged by his early views, and therefore drew a strong
line of demarcation between his early dialogues and the mature treatises
of his later philosophical system. Now, both were in the hands of
his readers in the time of Andronicus. Therefore his contemporary,
Cicero, who knew the early dialogues on <i>Philosophy</i>, the <i>Eudemus</i>
and the <i>Protrepticus</i>, and also among the mature scientific writings
the <i>Topics</i>, <i>Rhetoric</i>, <i>Politics</i>, <i>Physics</i> and <i>De Coelo</i>, to some extent,
was justified by Aristotle&rsquo;s example and precept in drawing the line
between two kinds of books, one written popularly, called exoteric, the
other more accurately (Cic. <i>De Finibus</i>, v. 5). But there was no doubt
a tendency to extend the term &ldquo;exoteric&rdquo; from the dialectical to the
more popular of the scientific writings of Aristotle, to make a new distinction
between exoteric and acroamatic or esoteric, and even to
make out that Aristotle was in the habit of teaching both exoterically
and acroamatically day by day as head of the Peripatetic school
at Athens. Aulus Gellius in the 2nd century <span class="scs">A.D.</span> supplies the best
proof of this growth of tradition in his <i>Noctes Atticae</i> (xx. 5). He
says that Aristotle (1) divided his <i>commentationes</i> and arts taught to
his pupils into <span class="grk" title="exoterika">&#7952;&#958;&#969;&#964;&#949;&#961;&#953;&#954;&#940;</span> and <span class="grk" title="akroatika">&#7936;&#954;&#961;&#959;&#945;&#964;&#953;&#954;&#940;</span>; (2) taught the latter in
the morning walk (<span class="grk" title="eothinon peripaton">&#7952;&#969;&#952;&#953;&#957;&#8056;&#957; &#960;&#949;&#961;&#943;&#960;&#945;&#964;&#959;&#957;</span>), the former in the evening
walk (<span class="grk" title="deilinon peripaton">&#948;&#949;&#953;&#955;&#953;&#957;&#8056;&#957; &#960;&#949;&#961;&#943;&#960;&#945;&#964;&#959;&#957;</span>); (3) divided his books in the same
manner; (4) defended himself against Alexander&rsquo;s letter, complaining
that it was not right to his pupils to have published his acroamatic
works, by replying in a letter that they were published and not
published, because they are intelligible only to those who heard them.
Gellius then quotes this correspondence, also given by Plutarch, and
quotes it <i>ex Andronici philosophi libro</i>. The answer to the first three
points is that Aristotle did not make any distinction between exoteric
and acroamatic, and was not likely to have any longer taught his
exoteric dialogues when he was teaching his mature philosophy at
Athens, but may have alternated the teaching of the latter between
the more abstruse and the more popular parts which had gradually
come to be called &ldquo;exoteric.&rdquo; As regards the last point, the authority
of Andronicus proves that he at all events did not exaggerate his own
share in publishing Aristotle&rsquo;s works; but it does not prove either
that this correspondence between Alexander and Aristotle took place,
or that Aristotle called his philosophical writings acroamatic, or that
he had published them wholesale to the world.</p>
</div>

<p>The literary career of Aristotle falls into three periods,
(1) The early period; when he was writing and publishing
exoteric dialogues, but also tending to write didactic works, and
beginning his scientific writings, <i>e.g.</i> the <i>Politics</i> in 357, the
<i>Meteorologica</i> in 356. (2) The immature period; when he was
continuing his didactic and scientific works, and composing first
drafts, <i>e.g.</i> the <i>Categories</i>, the <i>Eudemian Ethics</i>, the <i>Magna
Moralia</i>, the <i>Rhetoric to Alexander</i>. (3) The mature period;
when he was finishing his scientific works, completing his system,
and not publishing it but teaching it in the Peripatetic school;
when he would teach not his early dialogues, nor his immature
writings and first drafts, but mature works, <i>e.g.</i> the <i>Metaphysics</i>,
the <i>Nicomachean Ethics</i>, the <i>Rhetoric</i>; and above all teach his
whole system as far as possible in the real order of his classification
of science.</p>

<p class="pt2 center sc">VI. The Aristotelian Philosophy</p>

<p>We have now (1) sketched the life of Aristotle as a reader and a
writer from early manhood; (2) have watched him as a Platonist,
partly imitating but gradually emancipating himself from his
master to form a philosophy of his own; (3) have traced the
gradual composition of his writings from Plato&rsquo;s time onwards;
(4) have distinguished earlier, more Platonic and rudimentary,
from later, more independent and mature, writings; (5) have
founded the real order of his writings, not on chronology, nor
on tradition, but on his classification of science and learning. It
remains to answer the final question:&mdash;What is the Aristotelian
philosophy, which its author gradually formed with so much
labour? Here we have only room for its spirit, which we shall
try to give as if he were himself speaking to us, as head of the
Peripatetic school at Athens, and holding no longer the early
views of his dialogues, or the immature views of such treatises as
the <i>Categories</i>, but only his mature views, such as he expresses
in the <i>Metaphysics</i>. Aristotle was primarily a metaphysician, a
philosopher of things, who uses the objective method of proceeding
from being to thinking. We shall begin therefore with that
primary philosophy which is the real basis of his philosophy, and
proceed in the order of his classification of science to give his chief
doctrines on:&mdash;</p>

<div class="list">
<p>(1) Speculative philosophy, metaphysical and physical,
including his psychology, and with it his logic.</p>

<p>(2) Practical philosophy, ethics and politics.</p>

<p>(3) Productive science, or art.</p>
</div>

<p><i>Things are substances</i> (<span class="grk" title="ousiai">&#959;&#8016;&#963;&#943;&#945;&#953;</span>), each of which is a separate
individual (<span class="grk" title="choriston, tode ti, kath ekaston">&#967;&#969;&#961;&#953;&#963;&#964;&#972;&#957;, &#964;&#972;&#948;&#949; &#964;&#953;, &#954;&#945;&#952;&#8125; &#7957;&#954;&#945;&#963;&#964;&#959;&#957;</span>) and is variously
affected as quantified, qualified, related, active, passive and so
forth, in categories of things which are attributes (<span class="grk" title="sumbebaekota">&#963;&#965;&#956;&#946;&#949;&#946;&#951;&#954;&#972;&#964;&#945;</span>),
different from the category of substance, but real only as predicates
belonging to some substance, and are in fact only the
substance itself affected (<span class="grk" title="auto peponthos">&#945;&#8016;&#980;&#8056; &#960;&#949;&#960;&#959;&#957;&#952;&#972;&#962;</span>). The essence of each
substance, being what it is (<span class="grk" title="to tiest, to ti aen einai">&#964;&#8056; &#964;&#943; &#7952;&#963;&#964;&#953;, &#964;&#8056; &#964;&#943; &#7974;&#957; &#949;&#7990;&#957;&#945;&#953;</span>), is that
substance; <i>e.g.</i> this rational animal, Socrates. Substances are
so similar that the individuals of a species are even the same in
essence or substance, <i>e.g.</i> Callias and Socrates differ in matter but
are the same in essence, as rational animals. The universal (<span class="grk" title="to katholoy">&#964;&#8056; &#954;&#945;&#952;&#972;&#955;&#959;&#965;</span>)
is real only as one predicate belonging to many
individual substances: it is therefore not a substance. There
are then no separate universal forms, as Plato supposed. There
are attributes and universals, real as belonging to individual
substances, whose being is their being. The mind, especially
in mathematics, abstracts numbers, motions, relations, causes,
essences, ends, kinds; and it over-abstracts things mentally
separate into things really separate. But reality consists only
of individual substances, numerous, moving, related, active as
efficient causes, passive as material causes, essences as formal
causes, ends as final causes, and in classes which are real
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page520" id="page520"></a>520</span>
universals only as real predicates of individual substances.
Such is Aristotle&rsquo;s realism of individuals and universals, contained
in his primary philosophy, as expressed in the <i>Metaphysics</i>,
especially in Book &Zeta;, his authoritative pronouncement on
being and substance.</p>

<p>The individual substances, of which the universe is composed,
fall into three great irreducible kinds: nature, God, man.</p>

<p>I. Nature.&mdash;The obvious substances are natural substances
or bodies (<span class="grk" title="physikai ousiai, somata">&#966;&#965;&#963;&#953;&#954;&#945;&#8054; &#959;&#8016;&#963;&#943;&#945;&#953;, &#963;&#974;&#956;&#945;&#964;&#945;</span>), <i>e.g.</i> animals, plants, water,
earth, moon, sun, stars. Each natural substance is a compound
(<span class="grk" title="syntheton, synthetae, ousia">&#963;&#973;&#957;&#952;&#949;&#964;&#959;&#957;, &#963;&#965;&#957;&#952;&#941;&#964;&#951; &#959;&#8016;&#963;&#943;&#945;</span>) of essence and matter; its essence
(<span class="grk" title="eldos, morphae, to ti esti, to ti aen einai">&#949;&#7984;&#948;&#959;&#962;, &#956;&#959;&#961;&#966;&#942;, &#964;&#8056; &#964;&#943; &#7952;&#963;&#964;&#953;, &#964;&#8056; &#964;&#943; &#7974;&#957; &#949;&#7990;&#957;&#945;&#953;</span>) being its actual substance,
its matter (<span class="grk" title="ulae">&#8021;&#955;&#951;</span>) not; its essence being determinate, its matter
not; its essence being immateriate, its matter conjoined with the
essence; its essence being one in all individuals of a species, its
matter different in each individual; its essence being cause of
uniformity, its matter cause of accident. At the same time,
matter is not nothing, but something, which, though not substance,
is potentially substance; and it is either proximate to
the substance, or primary; proximate, as a substance which is
potentially different, <i>e.g.</i> wood potentially a table; primary, as
an indeterminate something which is a substratum capable of
becoming natural substances, of which it is always one; and it is
primarily the matter of earth, water, air, fire, the four simple
bodies (<span class="grk" title="apla somata">&#7937;&#960;&#955;&#8118; &#963;&#974;&#956;&#945;&#964;&#945;</span>) with natural rectilineal motions in the
terrestrial world (<i>De Gen. et Cor</i>. ii. I seq.); while aether (<span class="grk" title="aithaer">&#945;&#7984;&#952;&#942;&#961;</span>)
is a fifth simple body, with natural circular motion, being the
element of the stars (<span class="grk" title="to ton astron stoicheion">&#964;&#8056; &#964;&#8182;&#957; &#7940;&#963;&#964;&#961;&#969;&#957; &#963;&#964;&#959;&#953;&#967;&#949;&#8150;&#959;&#957;</span>) in the celestial
world. Each natural substance is a formal cause, as being what
it is; a material cause, as having passive power to be changed;
an efficient cause, as having active power to change, by communicating
the selfsame essence into different matter so as to
produce therein a homogeneous effect in the same species; and
a final cause, as an end to be realized. Moreover, though each
natural substance is corruptible (<span class="grk" title="phtharton">&#966;&#952;&#945;&#961;&#964;&#972;&#957;</span>), species is eternal
(<span class="grk" title="aidion">&#7936;&#7986;&#948;&#953;&#959;&#957;</span>), because there was always some individual of it to continue
its original essence (expressed by the imperfect tense in
<span class="grk" title="to ti aen einai">&#964;&#8056; &#964;&#943; &#7974;&#957; &#949;&#7990;&#957;&#945;&#953;</span>), which is ungenerated and incorruptible; the
natural world therefore is eternal; and nature is for ever aiming
at an eternal propagation, by efficient acting on matter, of
essence as end. For even nature does nothing in vain, but aims
at final causes, which she uniformly realizes, except so far as
matter by its spontaneity (<span class="grk" title="apo tou automatou">&#7936;&#960;&#8056; &#964;&#959;&#8166; &#945;&#8016;&#964;&#959;&#956;&#940;&#964;&#959;&#965;</span>) causes accidental
effects; and the ends of nature are no form of good, nor even the
good of man, but the essences of natural substances themselves,
and, above them all, the good God Himself. Such is Aristotle&rsquo;s
natural realism, pervading his metaphysical and physical
writings.</p>

<p>II. <i>God</i>.&mdash;Nature is but one kind of being (<span class="grk" title="en gar ti genos tou ontos ae physis">&#7955;&#957; &#947;&#940;&#961; &#964;&#953; &#947;&#941;&#957;&#959;&#962; &#964;&#959;&#8166; &#8004;&#957;&#964;&#959;&#962; &#7969; &#966;&#973;&#963;&#953;&#962;</span>, <i>Met.</i> &Gamma; 3, 1005 a 34). Above all natural substances,
the objects of natural science, there stands a supernatural
substance, the object of metaphysics as theology.
Nature&rsquo;s boundary is the outer sphere of the fixed stars, which
is eternally moved day after day in a uniform circle round the
earth. Now, an actual cause is required for an actual effect.
Therefore, there must be a prime mover of that prime movable,
and equally eternal and uniform. That prime mover is God,
who is not the creator, but the mover directly of the heavens,
and indirectly through the planets of sublunary substances. But
God is no mechanical mover. He moves as motive (<span class="grk" title="kinei de
os eromenon">&#954;&#953;&#957;&#949;&#8150; &#948;&#8050; &#8033;&#962; &#7952;&#961;&#974;&#956;&#949;&#957;&#959;&#957;</span>, <i>Met.</i> &Lambda; 7, 1072 b 3); He is the efficient only as the
final cause of nature. For God is a living being, eternal, very
good (<span class="grk" title="zoov aision ariston">&#950;&#8183;&#959;&#957; &#7936;&#7988;&#948;&#953;&#959;&#957; &#7940;&#961;&#953;&#963;&#964;&#959;&#957;</span>, <i>ib.</i> 1072 b 29). While nature aims at
Him as design, as an end, a motive, a final cause, God&rsquo;s occupation
(<span class="grk" title="diagogae">&#948;&#953;&#945;&#947;&#969;&#947;&#942;</span>) is intelligence (<span class="grk" title="noaesis">&#957;&#972;&#951;&#963;&#953;&#962;</span>); and since essence, not
indeed in all being, but in being understood, becomes identical
with intelligence, God in understanding essence is understanding
Himself; and in short, God&rsquo;s intelligence is at once intelligence
of Himself, of essence and of intelligence,&mdash;<span class="grk" title="kai estin ae noaesis
noaeseos noaesis">&#954;&#945;&#8054; &#7956;&#963;&#964;&#953;&#957; &#7969; &#957;&#972;&#951;&#963;&#953;&#962; &#957;&#959;&#942;&#963;&#949;&#969;&#962; &#957;&#972;&#951;&#963;&#953;&#962;</span> (<i>Met.</i> &Lambda; 7, 1074 b 34). But at the same time the
essence of good exists not only in God and God&rsquo;s intelligence on
the one hand, but also on the other hand on a declining scale in
nature, as both in a general and in his army; but rather in God,
and more in some parts of nature than in others. Thus even
God is a substance, a separate individual, whose differentiating
essence is to be a living being, eternal and very good; He is
however the only substance whose essence is entirely without
matter and unconjoined with matter; and therefore He is a
substance, not because He has or is a substratum beneath
attributes, but wholly because He is a separate individual,
different both from nature and men, yet the final good of
the whole universe. Such is Aristotle&rsquo;s theological realism
without materialism and the origin of all spiritualistic realism,
contained in his <i>Metaphysics</i> (&Lambda; 6-end).</p>

<p>III. <i>Man</i>.&mdash;There is a third kind of substance, combining
something both of the natural and of the divine: we men are
that privileged species. Each man is a substance, like any other,
only because he is a separate individual. Like any natural
substance, he is composed of matter and immateriate essence.
But natural substances are inorganic and organic; and a man
is an organic substance composed of an organic body (<span class="grk" title="organikon
soma">&#8000;&#961;&#947;&#945;&#957;&#953;&#954;&#8056;&#957; &#963;&#8182;&#956;&#945;</span>) as matter, and a soul (<span class="grk" title="psychae">&#968;&#965;&#967;&#942;</span>) as essence, which is the primary
actuality of an organic body capable of life (<span class="grk" title="zoae">&#950;&#969;&#942;</span>). Still a man is
not the only organism; and every organism has a soul, whose
immediate organ is the spirit (<span class="grk" title="pneuma">&#960;&#957;&#949;&#8166;&#956;&#945;</span>), a body which&mdash;analogous
to a body diviner than the four so-called elements, namely the
aether, the element of the stars&mdash;gives to the organism its non-terrestrial
vital heat, whether it be a plant or an animal. In an
ascending scale, a plant is an organism with a nutritive soul;
an animal is a higher organism with a nutritive, sensitive,
orectic and locomotive soul; a man is the highest organism with
a nutritive, sensitive, orectic, locomotive and rational soul.
What differentiates man from other natural and organic substances,
and approximates him to a supernatural substance, God,
is reason (<span class="grk" title="logos">&#955;&#972;&#947;&#959;&#962;</span>), or intellect (<span class="grk" title="nous">&#957;&#959;&#8166;&#962;</span>). Now, though only one of the
powers of the soul, intellect alone of these powers has no bodily
organ; it alone is immortal: it alone is divine. While the soul
is propagated, like any other essence, by the efficient, which is
the seed, to the matter, which is the germ, of the embryo man,
intellect alone enters from without (<span class="grk" title="thurathen">&#952;&#973;&#961;&#945;&#952;&#949;&#957;</span>), and is alone divine
(<span class="grk" title="theion">&#952;&#949;&#8150;&#959;&#957;</span>, not <span class="grk" title="theos">&#952;&#949;&#972;&#962;</span>), because its activity communicates with no
bodily activity (<i>De Gen.</i> ii. 3, 736-737). A man then is a third
kind of substance, like a natural substance in bodily matter, like
a supernatural substance in divine reason or intellect. Such is
Aristotle&rsquo;s dual, or rather triple, realism, continued in his <i>De
Anima</i> and other biological writings, especially <i>De Generatione
Animalium</i>, ii.</p>

<p>There are three points about a man&rsquo;s life which both connect
him with, and distinguish him from, God. God&rsquo;s occupation is
speculative; man&rsquo;s is speculation, practice and production.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>I. <i>Speculation</i> (<span class="grk" title="theoria">&#952;&#949;&#969;&#961;&#943;&#945;</span>).&mdash;Since things are individuals, and there
is nothing, and nothing universal, beyond them, there are two
kinds of knowledge (<span class="grk" title="gnosis">&#947;&#957;&#8182;&#963;&#953;&#962;</span>), sense (<span class="grk" title="aisthaesis">&#945;&#7988;&#963;&#952;&#951;&#963;&#953;&#962;</span>) of individuals, intellect
(<span class="grk" title="nous">&#957;&#959;&#8166;&#962;</span>) of universals. Both powers know by being passively receptive
of essence propagated by an efficient cause; but, while in sense the
efficient cause is an external object (<span class="grk" title="exothen">&#7956;&#958;&#969;&#952;&#949;&#957;</span>), in intelligence it is active
intellect (<span class="grk" title="nous to poiein">&#957;&#959;&#8166;&#962; &#964;&#8183; &#960;&#959;&#953;&#949;&#8150;&#957;</span>) propagating its essence in passive intellect
(<span class="grk" title="nous pathaetikos">&#957;&#959;&#8166;&#962; &#960;&#945;&#952;&#951;&#964;&#953;&#954;&#972;&#962;</span>). Nevertheless, without sense there is no knowledge.
Sense receives from the external world an essence, <i>e.g.</i> of white, which
is really universal as well as individual, but apprehends it only as
individual, <i>e.g.</i> this white substance: intellect thereupon discovers
the universal essence but only in the individuals of sense. This
intellectual discovery requires sensation and retention of sensation;
so that sense (<span class="grk" title="aisthaesis">&#945;&#7988;&#963;&#952;&#951;&#963;&#953;&#962;</span>) receives impressions, imagination (<span class="grk" title="phantasia">&#966;&#945;&#957;&#964;&#945;&#963;&#943;&#945;</span>)
retains them as images, intellect (<span class="grk" title="nous">&#957;&#959;&#8166;&#962;</span>) generalizes the universal, and,
when it is intelligence of essence, is always true.</p>

<p>This is the origin of knowledge, psychologically regarded (in the <i>De
Anima</i>). Logically regarded, the origin of all teaching and learning
of an intellectual kind is a process of induction (<span class="grk" title="epagogae">&#7952;&#960;&#945;&#947;&#969;&#947;&#942;</span>) from particulars
to universal, and of syllogism (<span class="grk" title="syllogismos">&#963;&#965;&#955;&#955;&#959;&#947;&#953;&#963;&#956;&#972;&#962;</span>) from universal
to further particulars; induction, whenever it starts from sense,
becomes the origin of scientific knowledge (<span class="grk" title="epiostaemae">&#7952;&#960;&#953;&#963;&#964;&#942;&#956;&#951;</span>); while there
is also a third process of example (<span class="grk" title="paradeigma">&#960;&#945;&#961;&#940;&#948;&#949;&#953;&#947;&#956;&#945;</span>) from particular to
particular, which produces only persuasion. In acquiring scientific
knowledge, syllogism cannot start from universals without induction,
nor induction acquire universals without sense. At the same time,
there are three species of syllogism, scientific, dialectical and eristical
or sophistical; and in consequence there are different ways of
acquiring premisses. In order to acquire the knowledge of the true
and primary principles of scientific knowledge, and especially the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page521" id="page521"></a>521</span>
intelligence of the universal essence of the subject, which is always
true, the process of knowledge consists of (1) sense (<span class="grk" title="aisthaesis">&#945;&#7988;&#963;&#952;&#951;&#963;&#953;&#962;</span>), which
receives the essence as individual, (2) memory (<span class="grk" title="mnaemae">&#956;&#957;&#942;&#956;&#951;</span>), which is a
retention of sensible impression, (3) experience (<span class="grk" title="empeiria">&#7952;&#956;&#960;&#949;&#953;&#961;&#943;&#945;</span>), which consists
of a number of similar memories, (4) induction (<span class="grk" title="epagogae">&#7952;&#960;&#945;&#947;&#969;&#947;&#942;</span>), which infers
the universal as a fact (<span class="grk" title="to oti">&#964;&#8056; &#8005;&#964;&#953;</span>), (5) intellect (<span class="grk" title="nous">&#957;&#959;&#8166;&#962;</span>), which apprehends the
principle (<span class="grk" title="archae">&#7936;&#961;&#967;&#942;</span>); because it is a true apprehension that the universal
induced is the very essence and formal cause of the subject: thereupon,
scientific syllogism (<span class="grk" title="epistaemonikos syllogismos">&#7952;&#960;&#953;&#963;&#964;&#951;&#956;&#959;&#957;&#953;&#954;&#8056;&#962; &#963;&#965;&#955;&#955;&#959;&#947;&#953;&#963;&#956;&#972;&#962;</span>), making the definition
(<span class="grk" title="horismos">&#8001;&#961;&#953;&#963;&#956;&#959;&#962;</span>) of this essence the middle term (<span class="grk" title="to meson">&#964;&#8056; &#956;&#941;&#963;&#959;&#957;</span>), becomes a
demonstration (<span class="grk" title="apodeixis">&#8001;&#961;&#953;&#963;&#956;&#959;&#962;</span>) of the consequences which follow from
the essence in the conclusion. Such then is science. In order to
acquire the probabilities (<span class="grk" title="ta endoxa">&#964;&#8048; &#7956;&#957;&#948;&#959;&#958;&#945;</span>) of opinion (<span class="grk" title="doxa">&#948;&#972;&#958;&#945;</span>), which are the
premisses of dialectical syllogism, the process is still induction, as in
science, but dialectical induction by interrogation from the opinions
of the answerers until the universal is conceded: thereupon the dialectical
syllogism (<span class="grk" title="dialektikos syllogismos">&#948;&#953;&#945;&#955;&#949;&#954;&#964;&#953;&#954;&#8056;&#962; &#963;&#965;&#955;&#955;&#959;&#947;&#953;&#963;&#956;&#972;&#962;</span>) deduces consequent opinions
in the conclusion. Nor does the process of acquiring the premisses
of eristical syllogism, which is fallacious either in its premisses or
in its process, differ, except that, when the premisses are fallacious,
the dialectical interrogations must be such as to cause this fallacy.
Hence, as science and dialectic are different, so scientific induction
and syllogism must be distinguished from dialectical induction and
syllogism. Dialectic is useful, for exercise, for conversation and for
philosophical sciences, where by being critical it has a road to principles.
But it is by a different process of sense, memory, experience,
induction, intelligence, syllogism, that science becomes knowledge of
real causes, of real effects, and especially of real essences from which
follow real consequences, not beyond, but belonging to real substances.
So can we men, not, as Plato thought, by having in our
souls universal principles innate but forgotten, but by acquiring
universal principles from sense, which is the origin of knowledge, arrive
at judgments which are true, and true because they agree with the
things which we know by sense, by inference and by science. Such
is Aristotle&rsquo;s psychological and logical realism, contained in the <i>De
Anima</i> and logical treatises.</p>

<p>2. <i>Practice</i> (<span class="grk" title="praxis">&#960;&#961;&#8118;&#958;&#953;&#962;</span>).&mdash;In this natural world of real substances,
human good is not an imitation of a supernatural universal form of
the good, but is human happiness; and this good is the same both of
the individual as a part and of the state as a whole. Ethics then is
a kind of Politics. But in Ethics a man&rsquo;s individual good is his own
happiness; and his happiness is no mere state, but an activity of soul
according to virtue in a mature life, requiring as conditions moderate
bodily and external goods of fortune; his virtue is (1) moral virtue,
which is acquired by habituation, and is a purposive habit of performing
actions in the mean determined by right reason or prudence;
requiring him, not to exclude, but to moderate his desires; and (2)
intellectual virtue, which is either prudence of practical, or wisdom of
speculative intellect; and his happiness is a kind of ascending scale
of virtuous activities, in which moral virtue is limited by prudence,
and prudence by wisdom; so that the speculative life of wisdom is
the happiest and most divine, and the practical life of prudence and
moral virtue secondary and human. Good fortune in moderation is
also required as a condition of his happiness. Must we then, on account
of misfortunes, look with Solon at the end, and call no man
happy till he is dead? Or is this altogether absurd for us who say
that happiness is an activity? Virtuous activities determine happiness,
and a virtuous man is happy in this life, in spite of misfortunes
unless they be too great; while after death he will not feel the misfortunes
of the living so much as to change his happiness. Still,
for perfect happiness a man should prefer the speculative life of
divine intellect, and immortalize (<span class="grk" title="athanatizein">&#7936;&#952;&#945;&#957;&#945;&#964;&#943;&#950;&#949;&#953;&#957;</span>) as far as possible. For
intellect is what mainly makes a man what he is, and is divine and
immortal.</p>

<p>To turn from Ethics to Politics, the good of the individual on a
small scale becomes on a large scale the good of the citizen and the
state, whose end should be no far-off form of good, and no mere
guarantee of rights, but the happiness of virtuous action, the life
according to virtue, which is the general good of the citizen. Hence,
the citizen of the best state is he who has the power and the purpose
to be governed and govern for the sake of the life according to virtue.</p>

<p>A right government is one which aims at the general good, whereas
any government which aims at its own good is a deviation. Hence
governments are to be arranged from best to worst in the following
order:&mdash;</p>

<p class="in">I. Right governments (<span class="grk" title="orthai politeiai">&#8000;&#961;&#952;&#945;&#8054; &#960;&#959;&#955;&#953;&#964;&#949;&#943;&#945;&#953;</span>), aiming at the general
   good:&mdash;</p>
<div class="list">
     <p>i. Monarchy, of one excelling in virtue:</p>
    <p>ii. Aristocracy, of a class excelling in virtue:</p>
   <p>iii. Commonwealth, of the majority excelling in virtue.</p>
</div>
<p class="in">II. Deviations (<span class="grk" title="parekbaseis">&#960;&#945;&#961;&#949;&#954;&#946;&#940;&#963;&#949;&#953;&#962;</span>), aiming at the good of the government:&mdash;</p>
<div class="list">
     <p>i. Democracy, aiming at the good of the majority:</p>
    <p>ii. Oligarchy, aiming at the good of the few:</p>
   <p>iii. Tyranny, aiming at the good of one.</p>
</div>

<p class="noind">Such is Aristotle&rsquo;s practical philosophy, contained in his matured
<i>Nicomachean Ethics</i>, and his unfinished <i>Politics</i>.</p>

<p>3. <i>Production</i> (<span class="grk" title="poiaesis">&#960;&#959;&#943;&#951;&#963;&#953;&#962;</span>).&mdash;Production differs from practice in
being an activity (<span class="grk" title="enirgeia">&#7952;&#957;&#941;&#961;&#947;&#949;&#953;&#945;</span>; <i>e.g.</i> building) which is always a means
to a work (<span class="grk" title="ergon">&#7956;&#961;&#947;&#959;&#957;</span>; <i>e.g.</i> a house) beyond itself. Productive science,
or art, is an intellectual habit of true reasoning from appropriate
principles, acquired from experiences, and applied to the production
of the work which is the end of the art. All the arts are therefore at
once rational and productive. They are either for necessity (<i>e.g.</i>
medicine) or for occupation (<i>e.g.</i> poetry), the former being inferior
to the latter. Rhetoric is a faculty on any subject of investigating
what may be persuasive (<span class="grk" title="pithanon">&#960;&#953;&#952;&#945;&#957;&#972;&#957;</span>), which is the work of no other
art; its means are artificial and inartificial evidences (<span class="grk" title="pisteis">&#960;&#943;&#963;&#964;&#949;&#953;&#962;</span>),
and, among artificial evidences, especially the logical arguments of
example and enthymeme. Poetry is the art of producing representations;
(1) in words, rhythm and harmony (<span class="grk" title="harmonia">&#7937;&#961;&#956;&#959;&#957;&#943;&#945;</span>, &ldquo;harmony&rdquo; in
the original sense); (2) of men like ourselves, or better as in tragedy,
or worse as in comedy; (3) by means of narrative as in epic, or by
action as in the drama. The cause of poetry is man&rsquo;s instinct of
representation and his love of representations caused by the pleasure of
learning. Comedy is representation of men inferior in being ludicrous:
epic is like tragedy a representation of superior men, but by means of
narrative and unlimited in time: tragedy is a representation of an
action superior and complete, in a day if possible, by means of action,
and accomplishing by pity and fear the purgation of such passions
(<i>Poetics</i>, 1449 b 24). Music is a part of moral education; and for
this end we should use the most moral harmonies. But music has
also other ends and uses, and on the whole four; namely amusement,
virtue, occupation and purgation of the affections; for some
men are liable more than others to pity and fear and enthusiasm, but
from sacred melodies we see them, when they have heard those which
act orgiastically on the soul, becoming settled by a kind of medicine
and purgation (<span class="grk" title="katharsis">&#954;&#940;&#952;&#945;&#961;&#963;&#953;&#962;</span>), and being relieved with pleasure. Finally,
art is not morality, because its end is always a work of art, not
virtuous action: on the other hand, art is subordinate to morality,
because all the ends of art are but means to the end of life, and
therefore a work of art which offends against morality is opposed to the
happiness and the good of man. Such is Aristotle&rsquo;s productive
science or art, contained in his <i>Rhetoric</i> and <i>Poetics</i>, compared with
his <i>Ethics</i> and <i>Politics</i>.</p>
</div>

<p>Aristotle, even in this sketch of his system, shows himself
to be the philosopher of facts, who can best of all men bear
criticism; and indeed it must be confessed that he retained
many errors of Platonism and laid himself open to the following
objections. Two substances, being individuals, <i>e.g.</i> Socrates and
Callias, are in no way the same, but only similar, even in essence,
<i>e.g.</i> Socrates is one rational animal, Callias another. A universal,
<i>e.g.</i> the species man, is not predicate of many individuals
(<span class="grk" title="en kata pollon">&#7955;&#957; &#954;&#945;&#964;&#8048; &#960;&#959;&#955;&#955;&#8182;&#957;</span>, <i>Post. An.</i> i. II), but a whole number of
similar individuals, <i>e.g.</i> all men; and not a whole species,
but only an individual, is a predicate of such individual, <i>e.g.</i>
Socrates is a man, not all men, and one white thing, not
all white things. Consequently, a species or genus is not a
substance, as Aristotle says it is in the <i>Categories</i>
(inconsistently with his own doctrine of substances), but a whole
number of substances, <i>e.g.</i> all men, all animals. Similarly,
the universal essence of a species is not one and the
same as each individual essence, but is the whole number
of similar individual essences of the similar individuals of the
species, <i>e.g.</i> all rational animals. Consequently, the universal
essence of a species of substances is not one and the same eternal
essence in all the individuals of a species but only similar, and is
not substance as Aristotle calls it in the <i>Metaphysics</i>,
inconsistently with his own doctrine of substance, but is a whole
number of similar substances, <i>e.g.</i> all rational animals which are
what all men are. Hence again, the natural world of species and
essences is not eternal, but only endures as long as there are
individual substances. Hence, moreover, a natural substance or
body as an efficient cause or force causes an effect on another,
not by propagating one eternal essence of a species into the matter
of the other, but so far as we really understand force, by their
reciprocally preventing one another from occupying the same
place at the same moment on account of the mutual resistance of
any two bodies. The essence of a natural substance, <i>e.g.</i> wood,
is not immateriate, but is the whole body as what it is. The
matter of a natural substance is not a primary matter which is
one indeterminate substratum of all natural substances, but is
only one body as able to be changed by a force which is another
substance able to change it, <i>e.g.</i> a seed becoming wood, wood
becoming coal, &amp;c. A natural substance or body, therefore, is
not a heterogeneous compound of essence and matter, but is
essence as what it is, matter as able passively to be changed,
force as able actively to change. The simple bodies which are
the matter of the rest are not terrestrial earth, water, air, fire,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page522" id="page522"></a>522</span>
and a different celestial aether, but whatever elementary bodies
natural science, starting anew from mechanics and chemistry,
may determine to be the matter of all other bodies whatever.
Nature does not aim at God as end, but God, thinking and
willing ends, produces and acts on nature. Soul is not an
immateriate essence of an organic body capable, but an immateriate
conscious substance within an organic body. Sensation is not
the reception of the selfsame essence of an external body, but
one&rsquo;s perception of one&rsquo;s sentient organism as affected, and
especially of its organs resisting one another, <i>e.g.</i> one&rsquo;s lips,
hands, &amp;c., preventing one another from occupying the same
place at the same moment within one&rsquo;s organism. Intelligence
does not differ from sense by having no bodily organ, but the
nervous system is the bodily organ of both. Intelligence is not
active intellect propagating universal essence in passive intellect,
but only logical inference starting from sense, and both requiring
nervous body and conscious soul. It is not always a true apprehension
of essence, but often, especially in physical matter, such
as sound or heat or light, takes superficial effects to be the
essence of the thing. Aristotle did not altogether solve the
question, What is, and scarcely solved at all the question, How
do we know the external world?</p>

<p>We might continue to object. But at bottom there remains
the fundamental position of Aristotelianism, that all things are
substances, individuals separate though related; that some
things are attributes, real only as being some individual substance
somehow affected, or, as we should say, modified or determined;
and that without individual substances there is nothing, and
nothing universal apart from individuals. There remains too
the consequence that there are different substances, separate
from but related to one another; and these substances of three
irreducible kinds, natural, supernatural, human. Aristotelianism
has to be considered against the philosophy which preceded
it and against the philosophy which has since followed it. Platonism
preceded it, and was the metaphysical doctrine that all things
are supernatural&mdash;forms, gods, souls. Idealism has since followed
it, and is the metaphysical doctrine that all things are mind and
states of mind. Aristotelianism intervenes between ancient
Platonism and modern Idealism, and is the metaphysical doctrine
that all things are substances, natural and supernatural and
human. It is a philosophy of substantial things, standing as a
<i>via media</i> between a philosophy of the supernatural and a
philosophy of mind. There are three alternatives, which may be
put as questions which every thinker must ask himself. Are the
things which surround me in what I call the environment,&mdash;the
men, the animals, the plants, the ground, the stones, the water,
the air, the moon, the sun, the stars and God&mdash;are they shadows,
unsubstantial things, as formerly Platonism made all things to be
except the supernatural world of forms, gods and souls? Or are
they, as modern Idealism says, mind and states of mind? Or
are they really substances separate from, though related to,
myself, who am also a substance? The Aristotelian answer
is&mdash;&ldquo;Yes, all things are substances, but not all supernatural, nor
all mental; for some are natural substances, or bodies&rdquo;; and
by that answer Aristotelianism stands or falls.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p><span class="sc">Literature</span>.&mdash;The Aristotelian philosophy is to be studied first in
Aristotle&rsquo;s works, which are the best commentaries on one another;
the best complete edition is the Berlin edition (1831-1870), by Bekker
and Brandis, in which also are the fragments collected by V. Rose,
the scholia collected by Brandis, and the index compiled by Bonitz.
After reading the remains of the Peripatetic school, the Greek
commentators should be further studied in this edition. The Latin
commentators, the Arabians and the schoolmen show how Aristotle
has been the chief author of modern culture; while the vindication
of modern independence comes out in his critics, the greatest of whom
were Roger and Francis Bacon. Since the modern discovery of the
science of motion by Galileo which changed natural science, and the
modern revolution of philosophy by Descartes which changed metaphysics,
the study of Aristotle has become less universal; but it did
not die out, and received a fresh stimulus especially from Julius Pacius,
who going back through G. Zabarella to the Arabians, and himself
gifted with great logical powers, always deserves study in his editions
of the <i>Organon</i> and the <i>Physics</i> and in his <i>Doctrinae Peripateticae</i>.
In more recent times, as part of the growing conviction of the essentiality of everything Greek, Aristotle has received marked
attention. In France there are the works of Cousin (1835), Félix Ravaisson, who
wrote on the <i>Metaphysics</i> (1837-1846), and Barthélemy St Hilaire,
who translated the <i>Organon</i> and other works (1844 seq.). In
Germany there has been a host of commentaries, among which we
may mention the <i>Organon</i> edited (1844-1846) by F. Th. Waitz (not
so well as by Pacius), the <i>De Anima</i> edited (1833) by F.A.
Trendelenburg and later by A. Torstrik, the <i>Historia Animalium</i> by H. Aubert
and F. Wimmer (1868), the <i>Ethics</i> by K.L. Michelet (1827), the
<i>Metaphysics</i> by A. Schwegler (1847) and (best of all) by H. Bonitz
(1848), who is the most faithful of all commentators, because to great
industry and acumen he adds the rare gift of confessing when he does
not understand, and when he does not know what Aristotle might
have thought. With Aristotle&rsquo;s works before one, with the <i>Index
Aristotelicus</i>, and the edition and translation of the <i>Metaphysics</i> by
Bonitz on one side, and Zeller&rsquo;s <i>Die Philosophie der Griechen</i>, ii. 2,
&ldquo;Aristoteles&rdquo; (trans. by Costelloe and Muirhead), on the other side,
one can go a considerable way towards understanding the foundations
of Aristotelianism.</p>

<p>In England scholars tend to take up certain parts of Aristotle&rsquo;s
philosophy. Grote indeed intended to write a general account of
Aristotle like that of Plato; but his <i>Aristotle</i> went little further than
the logical writings. From Cambridge we have J.W. Blakesley&rsquo;s
<i>Life of Aristotle</i>, E.M. Cope&rsquo;s <i>Rhetoric</i>, Dr Henry Jackson&rsquo;s
<i>Nicomachean Ethics</i>, v., S.H. Butcher&rsquo;s <i>Poetics</i>, Hicks&rsquo;s <i>De Anima</i>,
J.E. Sandys&rsquo;s <i>Athenian Constitution</i>, Jebb&rsquo;s <i>Rhetoric</i> (ed. Sandys).
Oxford in particular, since the beginning of the 19th century, has kept alive the study of Aristotle. E. Cardwell in his edition
of the <i>Nicomachean Ethics</i> (1828) had the wisdom to found his text
on the Laurentian Manuscript (Kb); E. Poste wrote translations
of the <i>Posterior Analytics</i> and <i>Sophistici Elenchi</i>; R. Congreve
edited the <i>Politics</i>; A. Grant edited the <i>Nicomachean Ethics</i>;
E. Wallace translated and annotated the <i>De Anima</i>; B. Jowett
translated the <i>Politics</i>; W.L. Newman has edited the <i>Politics</i> in
four volumes; Dr Ogle has translated the <i>De Partibus Animalium</i>,
with notes; R. Shute wrote a <i>History of the Aristotelian Writings</i>;
Professor J.A. Stewart has written <i>Notes on the Nicomachean
Ethics</i>; Professor J. Burnet has issued an annotated edition of
the <i>Nicomachean Ethics</i>, and W.D. Ross has translated the
<i>Metaphysics</i>. All these are, or were, Oxford men; and it remains to
mention two others: I. Bywater, who as an Aristotelian scholar has
done much for the improvement of Bekker&rsquo;s text, especially of the

<p><span class="bold">ARISTOXENUS,<a name="ar106" id="ar106"></a></span> of Tarentum (4th century <span class="scs">B.C.</span>), a Greek
peripatetic philosopher, and writer on music and rhythm. He
was taught first by his father Spintharus, a pupil of Socrates,
and later by the Pythagoreans, Lamprus of Erythrae and Xenophilus,
from whom he learned the theory of music. Finally he
studied under Aristotle at Athens, and was deeply annoyed, it is
said, when Theophrastus was appointed head of the school on
Aristotle&rsquo;s death. His writings, said to have numbered four
hundred and fifty-three, were in the style of Aristotle, and dealt
with philosophy, ethics and music. The empirical tendency of
his thought is shown in his theory that the soul is related to the
body as harmony to the parts of a musical instrument. We have
no evidence as to the method by which he deduced this theory
(cf. T. Gomperz, <i>Greek Thinkers</i>, Eng. trans. 1905, vol. iii. p. 43).
In music he held that the notes of the scale are to be judged, not
as the Pythagoreans held, by mathematical ratio, but by the ear.
The only work of his that has come down to us is the three books
of the <i>Elements of Harmony</i> (<span class="grk" title="rythmika stoicheia">&#8165;&#965;&#952;&#956;&#953;&#954;&#8048; &#963;&#964;&#959;&#953;&#967;&#949;&#8150;&#945;</span>), an

After the revolution of 1868, when the mikado Mutsu-hito was

(1894-95). His younger brother, Prince Takehito Arisugawa
(b. 1862), was from 1879 to 1882 in the British navy, serving
in the Channel Squadron, and studied at the Naval College,
Greenwich. In the Chino-Japanese War of 1894-95 he was

<p><span class="bold">ARITHMETIC<a name="ar108" id="ar108"></a></span> (Gr. <span class="grk" title="arithmaetikae">&#7936;&#961;&#953;&#952;&#956;&#951;&#964;&#953;&#954;&#942;</span>, sc. <span class="grk" title="technae">&#964;&#941;&#967;&#957;&#951;</span>, the art of counting,
from <span class="grk" title="arithmos">&#7936;&#961;&#953;&#952;&#956;&#972;&#962;</span>, number), the art of dealing with numerical
quantities in their numerical relations.</p>

<p>1. Arithmetic is usually divided into <i>Abstract Arithmetic</i> and
<i>Concrete Arithmetic</i>, the former dealing with numbers and the
latter with concrete objects. This distinction, however, might
be misleading. In stating that the sum of 11d. and 9d. is 1s. 8d.
we do not mean that nine pennies when added to eleven pennies
produce a shilling and eight pennies. The sum of money
corresponding to 11d. may in fact be made up of coins in several
different ways, so that the symbol &ldquo;11d.&rdquo; cannot be taken as
denoting any definite concrete objects. The arithmetical fact is
that 11 and 9 may be regrouped as 12 and 8, and the statement
&ldquo;11d. + 9d. = 1s. 8d.&rdquo; is only an arithmetical statement in so far
as each of the three expressions denotes a numerical quantity
(§ 11).</p>

<p>2. The various stages in the study of arithmetic may be
arranged in different ways, and the arrangement adopted must
be influenced by the purpose in view. There are three main
purposes, the practical, the educational, and the scientific; <i>i.e.</i>
the subject may be studied with a view to technical skill in dealing
with the arithmetical problems that arise in actual life, or for
the sake of its general influence on mental development, or as an
elementary stage in mathematical study.</p>

<p>3. The practical aspect is an important one. The daily
activities of the great mass of the adult population, in countries
where commodities are sold at definite prices for definite
quantities, include calculations which have often to be performed
rapidly, on data orally given, and leading in general to
results which can only be approximate; and almost every branch
of manufacture or commerce has its own range of applications
of arithmetic. Arithmetic as a school subject has been largely
regarded from this point of view.</p>

<p>4. From the educational point of view, the value of arithmetic
has usually been regarded as consisting in the stress it lays on
accuracy. This aspect of the matter, however, belongs mainly
to the period when arithmetic was studied almost entirely for
commercial purposes; and even then accuracy was not found
always to harmonize with actuality. The development of
physical science has tended to emphasize an exactly opposite
aspect, viz. the impossibility, outside a certain limited range of
subjects, of ever obtaining absolute accuracy, and the consequent
importance of not wasting time in attempting to obtain results
beyond a certain degree of approximation.</p>

<p>5. As a branch of mathematics, arithmetic may be treated
logically, psychologically, or historically. All these aspects are
of importance to the teacher: the logical, in order that he may
know the end which he seeks to attain; the psychological, that
he may know how best to attain this end; and the historical, for
the light that history throws on psychology,</p>

<p>The logical arrangement of the subject is not the best for
elementary study. The division into abstract and concrete, for
instance, is logical, if the former is taken as relating to number
and the latter to numerical quantity (§ 11). But the result of a
rigid application of this principle would be that the calculation
of the cost of 3 &#8468; of tea at 2s. a &#8468; would be deferred until
after the study of logarithms. The psychological treatment
recognizes the fact that the concrete precedes the abstract and
that the abstract is based on the concrete; and it also recognizes
the futility of attempting a strictly continuous development of
the subject.</p>

<p>On the other hand, logical analysis is necessary if the subject
is to be understood. As an illustration, we may take the elementary
processes of addition, subtraction, multiplication and
division. These are still called in text-books the &ldquo;four simple
rules&rdquo;; but this name ignores certain essential differences.
(i) If we consider that we are dealing with numerical quantities,
we must recognize the fact that, while addition and subtraction
might in the first instance be limited to such quantities,
multiplication and division necessarily introduce the idea of
pure number. (ii) If on the other hand we regard ourselves as
dealing with pure number throughout, then, as multiplication is
continued addition, we ought to include in our classification
involution as continued multiplication. Or we might say that,
since multiplication is a form of addition, and division a form
of subtraction, there are really only two fundamental processes,
viz. addition and subtraction. (iii) The inclusion of the four
processes under one general head fails to indicate the essential
difference between addition and multiplication, as direct processes,
on the one hand, and subtraction and division, as inverse
processes, on the other (§ 59).</p>

<p>6. The present article deals mainly with the principles of the
subject, for which a logical arrangement is on the whole the more
convenient. It is not suggested that this is the proper order to be
adopted by the teacher.</p>

<p class="pt2 center sc">I. Number</p>

<p>7. <i>Ordinal and Cardinal Numbers</i>.&mdash;One of the primary
distinctions in the use of number is between ordinal and cardinal
numbers, or rather between the ordinal and the cardinal aspects
of number. The usual statement is that <i>one, two, three, ...</i> are
cardinal numbers, and <i>first, second, third, ...</i> are ordinal
numbers. This, however, is an incomplete statement; the words
one, two, three, ... and the corresponding symbols 1, 2, 3, ...
or I, II, III, ... are used sometimes as ordinals, <i>i.e.</i> to denote
the place of an individual in a series, and sometimes as cardinals,
<i>i.e.</i> to denote the total number since the commencement of the
series.</p>

<p>On the whole, the ordinal use is perhaps the more common.
Thus &ldquo;100&rdquo; on a page of a book does not mean that the page is
100 times the page numbered 1, but merely that it is the page
after 99. Even in commercial transactions, in dealing with
sums of money, the statement of an amount often has reference
to the last item added rather than to a total; and geometrical
measurements are practically ordinal (§ 26).</p>

<p>For ordinal purposes we use, as symbols, not only figures, such
as 1, 2, 3, ... but also letters, as a, b, c, ... Thus the pages of
a book may be numbered 1, 2, 3, ... and the chapters I, II, III, ... but
the sheets are lettered A, B, C, ... Figures and letters
may even be used in combination; thus 16 may be followed by
16a and 16b, and these by 17, and in such a case the ordinal
100 does not correspond with the total (cardinal) number up to
this point.</p>

<p>Arithmetic is supposed to deal with cardinal, not with ordinal
numbers; but it will be found that actual numeration, beyond
about three or four, is based on the ordinal aspect of number,
and that a scientific treatment of the subject usually requires a
return to this fundamental basis.</p>

<p>One difference between the treatment of ordinal and of
cardinal numbers may be noted. Where a number is expressed
in terms of various denominations, a cardinal number usually
begins with the largest denomination, and an ordinal number
with the smallest. Thus we speak of one thousand eight hundred
and seventy-six, and represent it by MDCCCLXXVI or 1876;
but we should speak of the third day of August 1876, and represent
it by 3. 8. 1876. It might appear as if the writing of 1876
was an exception to this rule; but in reality 1876, when used
in this way, is partly cardinal and partly ordinal, the first three
figures being cardinal and the last ordinal. To make the year
completely ordinal, we should have to describe it as the 6th year
of the 8th decade of the 8th century of the 2nd millennium; <i>i.e.</i>
we should represent the date by 3. 8. 6. 8. 9. 2, the total number
of years, months and days completed being 1875. 7. 2.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page524" id="page524"></a>524</span></p>

<p>In using an ordinal we direct our attention to a term of a series,
while in using a cardinal we direct our attention to the interval
between two terms. The total number in the series is the sum
of the two cardinal numbers obtained by counting up to any
interval from the beginning and from the end respectively; but
if we take the ordinal numbers from the beginning and from the
end we count one term twice over. Hence, if there are 365 days
in a year, the 100th day from the beginning is the 266th, not the
265th, from the end.</p>

<p>8. <i>Meaning of Names of Numbers</i>.&mdash;What do we mean by any
particular number, <i>e.g.</i> by <i>seven</i>, or by <i>two hundred and fifty-three</i>?
We can define <i>two</i> as <i>one and one</i>, and <i>three</i> as <i>one and one
and one</i>; but we obviously cannot continue this method for
ever. For the definition of large numbers we may employ either
of two methods, which will be called the <i>grouping</i> method and
the <i>counting</i> method.</p>

<p>(i) <i>Method of Grouping</i>.&mdash;The first method consists in defining
the first few numbers, and forming larger numbers by groups
or aggregates, formed partly by multiplication and partly by
addition. Thus, on the denary system (§16) we can give independent
definitions to the numbers up to ten, and then regard
(<i>e.g.</i>) fifty-three as a composite number made up of five tens and
three ones. Or, on the quinary-binary system, we need only give
independent definitions to the numbers up to five; the numbers
<i>six, seven</i>, ... can then be regarded as <i>five and one, five and two</i>, ...,
a fresh series being started when we get to <i>five and five</i>
or <i>ten.</i> The grouping method introduces multiplication into the
definition of large numbers; but this, from the teacher&rsquo;s point
of view, is not now such a serious objection as it was in the days
when children were introduced to millions and billions before they
had any idea of elementary arithmetical processes.</p>

<p>(ii) <i>Method of Counting</i>.&mdash;The second method consists in taking
a series of names or symbols for the first few numbers, and then
repeating these according to a regular system for successive
numbers, so that each number is defined by reference to the
number immediately preceding it in the series. Thus <i>two</i> still
means <i>one and one</i>, but <i>three</i> means <i>two and one</i>, not <i>one and one
and one.</i> Similarly <i>two hundred and fifty-three</i> does not mean two
hundreds, five tens and three ones, but <i>one</i> more than <i>two
hundred and fifty-two</i>; and the number which is called one
hundred is not defined as ten tens, but as one more than ninety-nine.</p>

<p>9. <i>Concrete and Abstract Numbers</i>.&mdash;Number is concrete or
abstract according as it does or does not relate to particular
objects. On the whole, the grouping method refers mainly to
concrete numbers and the counting method to abstract numbers.
If we sort objects into groups of ten, and find that there are five
groups of ten with three over, we regard the five and the three
as names for the actual sets of groups or of individuals. The
three, for instance, are regarded as a whole when we name them
<i>three.</i> If, however, we count these three as one, two, three, then
the number of times we count is an abstract number. Thus
number in the abstract is the number of times that the act of
counting is performed in any particular case. This, however,
is a description, not a definition, and we still want a definition for
&ldquo;number&rdquo; in the phrase &ldquo;number of times.&rdquo;</p>

<p>10. <i>Definition of &ldquo;Number.&rdquo;</i>&mdash;Suppose we fix on a certain
sequence of names &ldquo;one,&rdquo; &ldquo;two,&rdquo; &ldquo;three,&rdquo; ..., or symbols
such as 1, 2, 3, ...; this sequence being always the same. If we
take a set of concrete objects, and name them in succession &ldquo;one,&rdquo;
&ldquo;two,&rdquo; &ldquo;three,&rdquo; ..., naming each once and once only, we shall
not get beyond a certain name, <i>e.g.</i> &ldquo;six.&rdquo; Then, in saying that
the number of objects is six, what we mean is that the name of
the last object named is six. We therefore only require a definite
law for the formation of the successive names or symbols. The
symbols 1, 2, ... 9, 10, ..., for instance, are formed according
to a definite law; and in giving 253 as the <i>number</i> of a set of
objects we mean that if we attach to them the symbols 1, 2, 3,
... in succession, according to this law, the symbol attached
to the last object will be 253. If we say that this act of attaching
a symbol has been performed 253 times, then 253 is an
<i>abstract</i> (or <i>pure</i>) <i>number.</i></p>

<p>Underlying this definition is a certain assumption, viz. that if
we take the objects in a different order, the last symbol attached
will still be 253. This, in an elementary treatment of the subject,
must be regarded as axiomatic; but it is really a simple case of
mathematical induction. (See <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Algebra</a></span>.) If we take two objects
A and B, it is obvious that whether we take them as A, B, or as
B, A, we shall in each case get the sequence 1, 2. Suppose this
were true for, say, eight objects, marked 1 to 8. Then, if we
introduce another object anywhere in the series, all those coming
after it will be displaced so that each will have the mark formerly
attached to the next following; and the last will therefore
be 9 instead of 8. This is true, whatever the arrangement of the
original objects may be, and wherever the new one is introduced;
and therefore, if the theorem is true for 8, it is true for 9. But it
is true for 2; therefore it is true for 3; therefore for 4, and so on.</p>

<p>11. <i>Numerical Quantities</i>.&mdash;If the term <i>number</i> is confined to
number in the abstract, then number in the concrete may be
described as <i>numerical quantity</i>. Thus £3 denotes £1 taken
3 times. The £1 is termed the <i>unit.</i> A numerical quantity,
therefore, represents a certain unit, taken a certain number of
times. If we take £3 twice, we get £6; and if we take 3s. twice,
we get 6s., <i>i.e.</i> 6 times 1s. Thus arithmetical processes deal with
numerical quantities by dealing with numbers, provided the unit
is the same throughout. If we retain the unit, the arithmetic is
concrete; if we ignore it, the arithmetic is abstract. But in the
latter case it must always be understood that there is some unit
concerned, and the results have no meaning until the unit is
reintroduced.</p>

<p class="pt2 center sc">II. Notation, Numeration and Number-Ideation</p>

<p>12. <i>Terms used</i>.&mdash;The representation of numbers by spoken
sounds is called <i>numeration</i>; their representation by written
signs is called <i>notation</i>. The systems adopted for numeration and
for notation do not always agree with one another; nor do they
always correspond with the idea which the numbers subjectively
present. This latter presentation may, in the absence of any
accepted term, be called <i>number-ideation</i>; this word covering
not only the perception or recognition of particular numbers, but
also the formation of a number-concept.</p>

<p>13. <i>Notation of Numbers</i>.&mdash;The system which is now almost
universally in use amongst civilized nations for representing
cardinal numbers is the Hindu, sometimes incorrectly called the
Arabic, system. The essential features which distinguish this
from other systems are (1) the limitation of the number of
different symbols, only ten being used, however large the number
to be represented may be; (2) the use of the <i>zero</i> to indicate the
absence of number; and (3) the principle of local value, by which
a symbol in effect represents different numbers, according to its
position. The symbols denoting a number are called its <i>digits</i>.</p>

<p>A brief account of the development of the system will be found
under <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Numeral</a></span>. Here we are concerned with the principle,
the explanation of which is different according as we proceed on
the grouping or the counting system.</p>

<p>(i) On the grouping system we may in the first instance consider
that we have separate symbols for numbers from &ldquo;one&rdquo; to
&ldquo;nine,&rdquo; but that when we reach ten objects we put them in a
group and denote this group by the symbol used for &ldquo;one,&rdquo; but
printed in a different type or written of a different size or (in
teaching) of a different colour. Similarly when we get to ten
tens we denote them by a new representation of the figure denoting
one. Thus we may have:</p>

<table class="nobctr" style="width: 70%;" summary="Contents">
<tr><td class="tcr">ones</td> <td class="tcc">1</td> <td class="tcc">2</td> <td class="tcc">3</td> <td class="tcc">4</td> <td class="tcc">5</td> <td class="tcc">6</td> <td class="tcc">7</td> <td class="tcc">8</td> <td class="tcc">9</td></tr>
<tr><td class="tcr">tens</td> <td class="tcc">1</td> <td class="tcc">2</td> <td class="tcc">3</td> <td class="tcc">4</td> <td class="tcc">5</td> <td class="tcc">6</td> <td class="tcc">7</td> <td class="tcc">8</td> <td class="tcc">9</td></tr>
<tr><td class="tcr">hundreds,</td> <td class="tcc"><b>1</b></td> <td class="tcc"><b>2</b></td> <td class="tcc"><b>3</b></td> <td class="tcc"><b>4</b></td> <td class="tcc"><b>5</b></td> <td class="tcc"><b>6</b></td> <td class="tcc"><b>7</b></td> <td class="tcc"><b>8</b></td> <td class="tcc"><b>9</b></td></tr>
<tr><td class="tcr">&amp;c.&emsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td class="tcc">&amp;c.</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td class="tcc">&amp;c.</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;</td></tr>
</table>

<p>On this principle 24 would represent twenty-four, <b>24</b> two
hundred and forty, and <b>2</b>4 two hundred and four. To prevent
confusion the <i>zero</i> or &ldquo;nought&rdquo; is introduced, so that the
successive figures, beginning from the right, may represent ones, tens,
hundreds, ... We then have, <i>e.g.</i>, <b>24</b>0 to denote two hundreds
and four tens; and we may now adopt a uniform type for all the
figures, writing this 240.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page525" id="page525"></a>525</span></p>

<table class="nobctr" style="float: right; width: 100px;" summary="Illustration">
<tr><td class="figright1"><img style="width:49px; height:247px" src="images/img525.jpg" alt="" /></td></tr></table>

<p>(ii) On the counting system we may consider that we have a
series of objects (represented in the adjoining diagram by dots),
and that we attach to these objects in succession the
symbols 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 0, repeating this series
indefinitely. There is as yet no distinction between
the first object marked 1 and the second object marked
1. We can, however, attach to the 0&rsquo;s the same symbols,
1, 2, ... 0 in succession, in a separate column,
repeating the series indefinitely; then do the same with
every 0 of this new series; and so on. Any particular
object is then defined completely by the combination
of the symbols last written down in each series; and
this combination of symbols can equally be used to
denote the number of objects up to and including the
last one (§ 10).</p>

<p>In writing down a number in excess of 1000 it is
(except where the number represents a particular year) usual
in England and America to group the figures in sets of three,
starting from the right, and to mark off the sets by commas.
On the continent of Europe the figures are taken in sets of
three, but are merely spaced, the comma being used at the
end of a number to denote the commencement of a decimal.</p>

<p>The zero, called &ldquo;nought,&rdquo; is of course a different thing from
the letter O of the alphabet, but there may be a historical
connexion between them (§ 79). It is perhaps interesting to
note that the latter-day telephone operator calls 1907 &ldquo;nineteen
O seven&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;nineteen nought seven.&rdquo;</p>

<p>14. <i>Direction of the Number-Series</i>.&mdash;There is no settled
convention as to the direction in which the series of symbols
denoting the successive numbers one, two, three, ... is to be
written.</p>

<p>(i) If the numbers were written down in succession, they would
naturally proceed from left to right, thus:&mdash;1, 2, 3, ... This
system, however, would require that in passing to &ldquo;double
figures&rdquo; the figure denoting tens should be written either above
or below the figure denoting ones, <i>e.g.</i></p>

<table class="ws" summary="Contents">
<tr><td class="tcl">&nbsp;</td> <td class="tcl">1</td> <td class="tcl">&nbsp;</td></tr>
<tr><td class="tcl">1, 2, ... 8, 9,</td> <td class="tcl">0, 1, 2, ... or 1, 2, ... , 8, 9,</td> <td class="tcl">0, 1, 2, ...</td></tr>
<tr><td class="tcl">&nbsp;</td> <td class="tcl">&nbsp;</td> <td class="tcl">1</td></tr>
</table>

<p class="noind">The placing of the tens-figure to the left of the ones-figure will not
seem natural unless the number-series runs either up or down.</p>

<p>(ii) In writing down any particular number, the successive
powers of ten are written from right to left, <i>e.g.</i> 5,462,198 is</p>

<table class="nobctr" style="width: 50%;" summary="Contents">
<tr><td class="tcc f80">(6)</td> <td class="tcc f80">(5)</td> <td class="tcc f80">(4)</td> <td class="tcc f80">(3)</td> <td class="tcc f80">(2)</td> <td class="tcc f80">(1)</td> <td class="tcc f80">(0)</td></tr>
<tr><td class="tcc">5</td> <td class="tcc">4</td> <td class="tcc">6</td> <td class="tcc">2</td> <td class="tcc">1</td> <td class="tcc">9</td> <td class="tcc">8</td></tr>

On the other hand, in writing decimals, the sequence (of negative
powers) is from left to right.</p>

<p>(iii) In making out lists, schedules, mathematical tables (<i>e.g.</i>
a multiplication-table), statistical tables, &amp;c., the numbers are
written vertically downwards.  In the case of lists and schedules
the numbers are only ordinals; but in the case of mathematical
or statistical tables they are usually regarded as cardinals, though,
when they represent values of a continuous quantity, they must
be regarded as ordinals (§§ 26, 93).</p>

<p>(iv) In graphic representation measurements are usually made
upwards; the adoption of this direction resting on certain
deeply rooted ideas (§ 23).</p>

<p>This question of direction is of importance in reference to the
development of useful number-forms (§ 23); and the existence
of the two methods mentioned under (iii) and (iv) above produces
confusion in comparing numerical tabulation with graphical
representation.  It is generally accepted that the horizontal
direction of increase, where a horizontal direction is necessary,
should be from left to right; but uniformity as regards vertical
direction could only be attained either by printing mathematical
tables upwards or by taking &ldquo;downwards,&rdquo; instead of
&ldquo;upwards,&rdquo; as the &ldquo;positive&rdquo; direction for graphical purposes.
The downwards direction will be taken in this article as
the normal one for succession of numbers (<i>e.g.</i> in
multiplication), and, where the arrangement is horizontal, it is to
be understood that this is for convenience of printing.  It
should be noticed that, in writing the components of a
number 253 as 200, 50 and 3, each component beneath the next
larger one, we are really adopting the downwards principle, since
the figures which make up 253 will on this principle be successively
2, 5 and 3 (§ 13 (ii)).</p>

<p>15. <i>Roman Numerals.</i>&mdash;Although the Roman numerals are
no longer in use for representing cardinal numbers, except in
certain special cases (<i>e.g.</i> clock-faces, milestones and chemists&rsquo;
prescriptions), they are still used for ordinals.</p>

<p>The system differs completely from the Hindu system.  There
are no single symbols for two, three, &amp;c.; but numbers are
represented by combinations of symbols for one, five, ten, fifty,
one hundred, five hundred, &amp;c., the numbers which have single
symbols, viz. I, V, X, L, C, D, M, proceeding by multiples of five
and two alternately. Thus 1878 is MDCCCLXXVIII, <i>i.e.</i>
thousand five-hundred hundred hundred hundred fifty ten ten
five one one one.</p>

<p>The system is therefore essentially a cardinal and grouping
one, <i>i.e.</i>  it represents a number as the sum of sets of other
numbers.  It is therefore remarkable that it should now only
be used for ordinal purposes, while the Hindu system, which is
ordinal in its nature, since a single series is constantly repeated,
is used almost exclusively for cardinal numbers.  This fact
seems to illustrate the truth that the counting principle is the
fundamental one, to which the interpretation of grouped numbers
must ultimately be referred.</p>

<p>The normal process of writing the larger numbers on the left is in certain
cases modified in the Roman system by writing a number in front of a larger
one to denote subtraction.  Thus <i>four</i>, originally written IIII, was later
written IV.  This may have been due to one or both of two causes; a
primitive tendency to refer numbers, in numeration, to the nearest large
number (§ 24 (iv)), and the difficulty of perceiving the number of a group
of objects beyond about three (§ 22).  Similarly IX, XL and XC
were written for nine, forty and ninety respectively.  These,
however, were later developments.</p>

<p>16. <i>Scales of Notation.</i>&mdash;In the Hindu system the numbering
proceeds by tens, tens of tens, &amp;c.; thus the figure in the fifth
place, counting from the right, denotes the product of the
corresponding number by four tens in succession. The notation is
then said to be in the <i>scale</i> of which ten is the <i>base</i>, or in the
<i>denary scale.</i>  The Roman system, except for the use of symbols
for five, fifty, &amp;c., is also in the denary scale, though expressed
in a different way. The introduction of these other symbols
produces a compound scale, which may be called a <i>quinary-binary</i>,
or, less correctly, a <i>quinary-denary</i> scale.</p>

<p>The figures used in the Hindu notation might be used to express
numbers in any other scale than the denary, provided new
symbols were introduced if the base of the scale exceeded ten.
Thus 1878 in the quinary-binary scale would be 1131213, and
1828 would be 1130213; the meaning of these is seen at once
by comparison with MDCCCLXXVIII and MDCCCXXVIII.
Similarly the number which in the denary scale is 215 would in
the quaternary scale (base 4) be 3113, being equal to 3·4·4·4 +
1·4·4 + 1·4 + 3.</p>

<p>The use of the denary scale in notation is due to its use in
numeration (§ 18); this again being due (as exemplified by the
use of the word <i>digit</i>) to the primitive use of the fingers for
counting.  If mankind had had six fingers on each hand and six toes on
each foot, we should be using a <i>duodenary scale</i> (base twelve),
which would have been far more convenient.</p>

<p>17. <i>Notation of Numerical Quantities.</i>&mdash;Over a large part of the
civilized world the introduction of the metric system (§ 118) has
caused the notation of all numerical quantities to be in the denary
scale.  In Great Britain and her colonies, however, and in the
United States, other systems of notation still survive, though
there is none which is consistently in one scale, other than the
denary.  The method is to form quantities into groups, and these
again into larger groups; but the number of groups making one
of the next largest groups varies as we proceed along the scale.
The successive groups or units thus formed are called <i>denominations.</i>
Thus twelve pennies make a shilling, and twenty shillings
a pound, while the penny is itself divided into four farthings (or
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page526" id="page526"></a>526</span>
two halfpennies). There are, therefore, four denominations, the
bases for conversion of one denomination into the next being
successively four (or two), twelve and twenty. Within each
denomination, however, the denary notation is employed
exclusively, <i>e.g.</i> &ldquo;twelve shillings&rdquo; is denoted by 12s.</p>

<p>The diversity of scales appears to be due mainly to four
causes: (i) the tendency to group into scores (§ 20); (ii) the
tendency to subdivide into twelve; (in) the tendency to subdivide
into two or four, with repetitions, making subdivision into
sixteen or sixty-four; and (iv) the independent adoption of
different units for measuring the same kind of magnitude.</p>

<p>Where there is a division into sixteen parts, a binary scale may
be formed by dividing into groups of two, four or eight. Thus
the weights ordinarily in use for measuring from ¼ oz. up to
2 &#8468; give the basis for a binary scale up to not more than eight
figures, only 0 and 1 being used. The points of the compass
might similarly be expressed by numbers in a binary scale; but
the numbers would be ordinal, and the expressions would be
analogous to those of decimals rather than to those of whole
numbers.</p>

<p>In order to apply arithmetical processes to a quantity expressed
in two or more denominations, we must first express it in terms of
a single denomination by means of a varying scale of notation.
Thus £254, 13S. 6d. may be written <img style="width:110px; height:25px" src="images/img526a.jpg" alt="" /> each of
the numbers in brackets indicating the number of units in
one denomination that go to form a unit in the next higher
denomination. To express the quantity in terms of £, it ought
to be written <img style="width:88px; height:25px" src="images/img526b.jpg" alt="" /> this would mean £254 (13<span class="spp">6</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">12</span>)/20 or
£(254 + <span class="spp">13</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">20</span> + <span class="spp">6</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">20·12</span>), and therefore would involve a fractional
number.</p>

<p>A quantity expressed in two or more denominations is usually
called a <i>compound number</i> or <i>compound quantity</i>. The former
term is obviously incorrect, since a quantity is not a number;
and the latter is not very suggestive. For agreement with the
terminology of fractional numbers (§ 62) we shall describe such a
quantity as a <i>mixed quantity</i>. The letters or symbols descriptive
of each denomination are visually placed after or (in actual
calculations) above the figures denoting the numbers of the
corresponding units; but in a few cases, <i>e.g.</i> in the case of £, the
symbol is placed before the figures. There would be great
convenience in a general adoption of this latter method; the
combination of the two methods in such an expression as
£123, 16s. 4½d. is especially awkward.</p>

<p>18. <i>Numeration.</i>&mdash;The names of numbers are almost wholly
based on the denary scale; thus eighteen means eight and ten,
and twenty-four means twice ten and four. The words <i>eleven</i>
and <i>twelve</i> have been supposed to suggest etymologically a
denary basis (see, however, <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Numeral</a></span>).</p>

<p>Two exceptions, however, may be noted.</p>

<p>(i) The use of <i>dozen, gross</i> (= dozen dozen), and <i>great gross</i>
(= dozen gross) indicates an attempt at a duodenary basis. But
the system has never spread; and the word &ldquo;dozen&rdquo; itself is
based on the denary scale.</p>

<p>(ii) The <i>score</i> (twenty) has been used as a basis, but to an even
more limited extent. There is no essential difference, however,
between this and the denary basis. As the latter is due to
finger-reckoning, so the use of the fingers and the toes produced
a vigesimal scale. Examples of this are given in § 20; it is
worthy of notice that the vigesimal (or, rather, quinary-quaternary)
system was used by the Mayas of Yucatan, and also, in a
more perfect form, by the Nahuatl (Aztecs) of Mexico.</p>

<p>The number ten having been taken as the basis of numeration,
there are various methods that might consistently be adopted for
naming large numbers.</p>

<p>(i) We might merely name the figures contained in the number.
This method is often adopted in practical life, even as regards
mixed quantities; thus £57,593, 16s. 4d. would be read as <i>five
seven, five nine three, sixteen and four pence.</i></p>

<p>(ii) The word <i>ten</i> might be introduced, <i>e.g.</i> 593 would be <i>five
ten ten ninety</i> (= nine ten) <i>and three.</i></p>

<p>(iii) Names might be given to the successive powers of ten, up
to the point to which numeration of ones is likely to go. Partial
applications of this method are found in many languages.</p>

<p>(iv) A compromise between the last two methods would be to
have names for the series of numbers, beginning with ten, each of
which is the &ldquo;square&rdquo; of the preceding one. This would in effect
be analysing numbers into components of the form a. 10<span class="sp">b</span> where
<i>a</i> is less than 10, and the index <i>b</i> is expressed in the binary scale,
<i>e.g.</i> 7,000,000 would be 7·10<span class="sp">4</span>·10<span class="sp">2</span>, and 700,000 would be 7·10<span class="sp">4</span>·10<span class="sp">1</span>.</p>

<p>The British method is a mixture of the last two, but with an
index-scale which is partly ternary and partly binary. There are
separate names for ten, ten times ten (= <i>hundred</i>), and ten times
ten times ten (= <i>thousand</i>); but the next single name is <i>million</i>,
representing a thousand times a thousand. The next name is
<i>billion</i>, which in Great Britain properly means a million million,
and in the United States (as in France) a thousand million.</p>

<p>19. <i>Discrepancies between Numeration and Notation.</i>&mdash;Although
numeration and notation are both ostensibly on the denary
system, they are not always exactly parallel. The following
are a few of the discrepancies.</p>

<p>(i) A set of written symbols is sometimes read in more than
one way, while on the other hand two different sets of symbols
(at any rate if denoting numerical quantities) may be read in the
same way. Thus 1820 might be read as <i>one thousand eight
hundred and twenty</i> if it represented a number of men, but it
would be read as <i>eighteen hundred and twenty</i> if it represented a
year of the Christian era; while 1s. 6d. and 18d. might both be
read as <i>eighteenpence</i>. As regards the first of these two examples,
however, it would be more correct to write 1,820 for the former
of the two meanings (cf. § 13).</p>

<p>(ii) The symbols 11 and 12 are read as <i>eleven</i> and <i>twelve</i>, not
(except in elementary teaching) as <i>ten-one</i> and <i>ten-two</i>.</p>

<p>(iii) The names of the numbers next following these, up to
19 inclusive, only faintly suggest a <i>ten</i>. This difficulty is not
always recognized by teachers, who forget that they themselves
had to be told that <i>eighteen</i> means <i>eight-and-ten</i>.</p>

<p>(iv) Even beyond twenty, up to a hundred, the word <i>ten</i> is not
used in numeration, <i>e.g.</i> we say <i>thirty-four</i>, not <i>three ten four</i>.</p>

<p>(v) The rule that the greater number comes first is not universally
observed in numeration. It is not observed, for instance,
in the names of numbers from 13 to 19; nor was it in the names
from which <i>eleven</i> and <i>twelve</i> are derived. Beyond twenty it
is usually, but not always, observed; we sometimes instead of
<i>twenty-four</i> say <i>four and twenty</i>. (This latter is the universal
system in German, up to 100, and for any portion of 100 in
numbers beyond 100.)</p>

<p>20. <i>Other Methods of Numeration and Notation.</i>&mdash;It is only
possible here to make a brief mention of systems other than those
now ordinarily in use.</p>

<p>(i) <i>Vigesimal Scale.</i>&mdash;The system of counting by twenties
instead of by tens has existed in many countries; and, though
there is no corresponding notation, it still exhibits itself in the
names of numbers. This is the case, for instance, in the Celtic
languages; and the Breton or Gaulish names have affected the
Latin system, so that the French names for some numbers are on
the vigesimal system. This system also appears in the Danish
numerals. In English the use of the word <i>score</i> to represent
twenty&mdash;<i>e.g.</i> in &ldquo;threescore and ten&rdquo; for seventy&mdash;is superimposed
on the denary system, and has never formed an essential
part of the language. The word, like <i>dozen</i> and <i>couple</i>, is still in
use, but rather in a vague than in a precise sense.</p>

<p>(ii) <i>Roman System.</i>&mdash;The Roman notation has been explained
above (§ 15). Though convenient for exhibiting the composition
of any particular number, it was inconvenient for purposes of
calculation; and in fact calculation was entirely (or almost entirely)
performed by means of the abacus (<i>q.v.</i>). The numeration
was in the denary scale, so that it did not agree absolutely with
the notation. The principle of subtraction from a higher number,
which appeared in notation, also appeared in numeration, but not
for exactly the same numbers or in exactly the same way; thus
XVIII was two-from-twenty, and the next number was one-from-twenty,
but it was written XIX, not IXX.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page527" id="page527"></a>527</span></p>

<p>(iii) <i>Other Systems of Antiquity.</i>&mdash;The Egyptian notation was
purely denary, the only separate signs being those for 1, 10, 100,
&amp;c. The ordinary notation of the Babylonians was denary, but
they also used a sexagesimal scale, <i>i.e.</i> a scale whose base was 60.
The Hebrews had a notation containing separate signs (the
letters of the alphabet) for numbers from 1 to 10, then for multiples
of 10 up to 100, and then for multiples of 100 up to 400, and later
up to 1000.</p>

<p>The earliest Greek system of notation was similar to the
Roman, except that the symbols for 50, 500, &amp;c., were more
complicated. Later, a system similar to the Hebrew was adopted,
and extended by reproducing the first nine symbols of the series,
preceded by accents, to denote multiplication by 1000.</p>

<p>On the island of Ceylon there still exists, or existed till recently,
a system which combines some of the characteristics of the later
Greek (or Semitic) and the modern European notation; and it is
conjectured that this was the original Hindu system.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>For a further account of the above systems see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Numeral</a></span>, and
the authorities quoted at the end of the present article.</p>
</div>

<p>21. <i>The Number-Concept.</i>&mdash;It is probable that very few people
have any definite mental presentation of individual numbers
(<i>i.e.</i> numbers proceeding by differences of <i>one</i>) beyond 100, or at
any rate beyond 144. Larger numbers are grasped by forming
numbers into groups or by treating some large number as a unit.
A person would appreciate the difference between 93,000,000 m.
and 94,000,000 m. as the distance of the centre of the sun from
the centre of the earth at a particular moment; but he certainly
would not appreciate the relative difference between
93,000,000 m. and 93,000,001 m. In order to get an idea of
93,000,000, he must take a million as his unit. Similarly, in the
metric system he cannot mentally compare two units, one of
which is 1000 times the other. The metre and the kilometre,
for instance, or the metre and the millimetre, are not directly
comparable; but the metre can be conceived as containing 100
centimetres.</p>

<p>On the other hand, it would seem that, for most educated
people, sixteen and seventeen or twenty-six and twenty-seven,
and even eighty-six and eighty-seven, are single numbers, just
as six and seven are, and are not made up of groups of tens and
ones. In other words, the denary scale, though adopted in
notation and in numeration, does not arise in the corresponding
mental concept until we get beyond 100.</p>

<p>Again, in the use of decimals, it is unusual to give less than
two figures. Thus 3.142 or 3.14 would be quite intelligible; but
3.1 does not convey such a good idea to most people as either 3<span class="spp">1</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">10</span>
or 3.10, <i>i.e.</i> as an expression denoting a fraction or a percentage.</p>

<p>There appears therefore to be a tendency to use some larger
number than ten as a basis for grouping into new units or for
subdivision into parts. The Babylonians adopted 60 for both
these purposes, thus giving us the sexagesimal division of angles
and of time.</p>

<p>This view is supported, not only by the intelligibility of
percentages to ordinary persons, but also by the tendency, noted
above (§ 19), to group years into centuries, and to avoid the use
of thousands. Thus 1876 is not 1 thousand, 8 hundred, 7 tens
and 6, but 18 hundred and 76, each of the numbers 18 and 76
being named as if it were a single number. It is also in accordance
with what is so far known about number-forms (§ 23).</p>

<p>If there is this tendency to adopt 100 as a basis instead
of 10, the teaching of decimals might sometimes be simplified
by proceeding from percentages to percentages of percentages,
<i>i.e.</i> by commencing with <i>centesimals</i> instead of with <i>decimals.</i></p>

<p>22. <i>Perception of Number.</i>&mdash;In using material objects as a
basis for developing the number-concept, it must be remembered
that it is only when there are a few objects that their number
can be perceived without either counting or the performance of
some arithmetical process such as addition. If four coins are laid
on a table, close together, they can (by most adults) be seen to be
four, without counting; but seven coins have to be separated
mentally into two groups, the numbers of which are added, or
one group has to be seen and the remaining objects counted,
before the number is known to be seven.</p>

<p>The actual limit of the number that can be &ldquo;seen&rdquo;&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>
seen without counting or adding&mdash;depends for any individual on
the shape and arrangement of the objects, but under similar
conditions it is not the same for all individuals. It has been
suggested that as many as six objects can be seen at once; but
this is probably only the case with few people, and with them
only when the objects have a certain geometrical arrangement.
The limit for most adults, under favourable conditions, is about
four. Under certain conditions it is less; thus IIII, the old
Roman notation for <i>four</i>, is difficult to distinguish from III, and
this may have been the main reason for replacing it by IV (§ 15).</p>

<p>In the case of young children the limit is probably two. That
this was also the limit in the case of primitive races, and that the
classification of things was into one, two and many, before any
definite process of counting (<i>e.g.</i> by the fingers) came to be
adopted, is clear from the use of the &ldquo;dual number&rdquo; in language,
and from the way in which the names for three and four are often
based on those for one and two. With the individual, as with the
race, the limit of the number that can be seen gradually increases
up to four or five.</p>

<p>The statement that a number of objects can be seen to be three
or four is not to be taken as implying that there is a simultaneous
perception of all the objects. The attention may be directed
in succession to the different objects, so that the perception is
rhythmical; the distinctive rhythm thus aiding the perception
of the particular number.</p>

<p>In consequence of this limitation of the power of perception of
number, it is practically impossible to use a pure denary scale in
elementary number-teaching. If a quinary-binary system (such
as would naturally fit in with counting on the fingers) is not
adopted, teachers unconsciously resort to a binary-quinary
system. This is commonly done where cubes are used; thus
seven is represented by three pairs of cubes, with a single cube
at the top.</p>

<p>23. <i>Visualization of the Series.</i>&mdash;A striking fact, in reference
to ideas of number, is the existence of number-forms, <i>i.e.</i> of
definite arrangements, on an imagined plane or in space, of the
mental representations of the successive numbers from 1 onwards.
The proportion of persons in whom number-forms exist has been
variously estimated; but there is reason to believe that the forms
arise at a very early stage of childhood, and that they did at some
time exist in many individuals who have afterwards forgotten
them. Those persons who possess them are also apt to make
spatial arrangements of days of the week or the month, months of
the year, the letters of the alphabet, &amp;c.; and it is practically
certain that only children would make such arrangements of
letters of the alphabet. The forms seem to result from a general
tendency to visualization as an aid to memory; the letter-forms
may in the first instance be quite as frequent as the number-forms,
but they vanish in early childhood, being of no practical
value, while the number-forms continue as an aid to arithmetical
work.</p>

<p>The forms are varied, and have few points in common; but the
following tendencies are indicated.</p>

<p>(i) In the majority of cases the numbers lie on a continuous
(but possibly zigzag) line.</p>

<p>(ii) There is nearly always (at any rate in English cases) a break
in direction at 12. From 1 to 12 the numbers sometimes lie in the
circumference of a circle, an arrangement obviously suggested
by a clock-face; in these cases the series usually mounts upwards
from 12. In a large number of cases, however, the direction is
steadily upwards from 1 to 12, then changing. In some cases the
initial direction is from right to left or from left to right; but
there are very few in which it is downwards.</p>

<p>(iii) The multiples of 10 are usually strongly marked; but
special stress is also laid on other important numbers, <i>e.g.</i> the
multiples of 12.</p>

<p>(iv) The series sometimes goes up to very high numbers, but
sometimes stops at 100, or even earlier. It is not stated, in most
cases, whether all the numbers within the limits of the series
have definite positions, or whether there are only certain numbers
which form an essential part of the figure, while others only
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page528" id="page528"></a>528</span>
exist potentially. Probably the latter is almost universally
the case.</p>

<p>These forms are developed spontaneously, without suggestion
from outside. The possibility of replacing them by a standard
form, which could be utilized for performing arithmetical operations,
is worthy of consideration; some of the difficulties in the
way of standardization have already been indicated (§ 14). The
general tendency to prefer an upward direction is important; and
our current phraseology suggests that this is the direction which
increase is naturally regarded as taking. Thus we speak of counting
<i>up</i> to a certain number; and similarly mathematicians speak of
<i>high</i> and <i>ascending</i> powers, while engineers speak of high pressure,
high speed, high power, &amp;c. This tendency is probably aided by
the use of bricks or cubes in elementary number-teaching.</p>

<p>24. <i>Primitive Ideas of Number.</i>&mdash;The names of numbers give
an idea of the way in which the idea of number has developed.
Where civilization is at all advanced, there are usually certain
names, the origin of which cannot be traced; but, as we go
farther back, these become fewer, and the names are found to
be composed on certain systems. The systems are varied, and
it is impossible to lay down any absolute laws, but the following
seem to be the main conclusions.</p>

<p>(i) Amongst some of the lowest tribes, as (with a few exceptions)
amongst animals, the only differentiation is between one
and many, or between one, two and many, or between one, two,
three and many. As it becomes necessary to use higher but still
small numbers, they are formed by combinations of one and two,
or perhaps of three with one or two. Thus many of the Australasian
and South American tribes use only one and two; seven,
for instance, would be two two two one.</p>

<p>(ii) Beyond ten, and in many cases beyond five, the names have
reference to the use of the fingers, and sometimes of the toes, for
counting; and the scale may be quinary, denary or vigesimal,
according as one hand, the pair of hands, or the hands and feet,
are taken as the new unit. <i>Five</i> may be signified by the word for
hand; and either <i>ten</i> or <i>twenty</i> by the word for <i>man</i>. Or the
words signifying these numbers may have reference to the completion
of some act of counting. Between five and ten; or beyond
ten, the names may be due to combinations, <i>e.g.</i> 16 may be
10 + 5 + 1; or they may be the actual names of the fingers last
counted.</p>

<p>(iii) There are a few, but only a few, cases in which the number
6 or 8 is named as twice 3 or twice 4; and there are also a few
cases in which 7, 8 and 9 are named as 6 + 1, 6 + 2 and 6 + 3.
In the large majority of cases the numbers 6, 7, 8 and 9 are 5 + 1,
5 + 2, 5 + 3 and 5 + 4, being named either directly from their
composition in this way or as the fingers on the second hand.</p>

<p>(iv) There is a certain tendency to name 4, 9, 14 and 19 as being
one short of 5, 10, 15 and 20 respectively; the principle being thus
the same as that of the Roman IV, IX, &amp;c. It is possible that
at an early stage the number of the fingers on one hand or on
the two hands together was only thought of vaguely as a large
number in comparison with 2 or 3, and that the number did
not attain definiteness until it was linked up with the smaller
by insertion of the intermediate ones; and the linking up might
take place in both directions.</p>

<p>(v) In a few cases the names of certain small numbers are
the names of objects which present these numbers in some
conspicuous way. Thus the word used by the Abipones to denote
5 was the name of a certain hide of five colours. It has been
suggested that names of this kind may have been the origin of
the numeral words of different races; but it is improbable that
direct visual perception would lead to a name for a number
unless a name based on a process of counting had previously
been given to it.</p>

<p>25. <i>Growth of the Number-Concept.</i>&mdash;The general principle that
the development of the individual follows the development of the
race holds good to a certain extent in the case of the number-concept, but it is modified by the existence of language dealing
with concepts which are beyond the reach of the child, and also,
of course, by the direct attempts at instruction. One result is
the formation of a number-series as a mere succession of names
without any corresponding ideas of number; the series not being
necessarily correct.</p>

<p>When numbering begins, the names of the successive numbers
are attached to the individual objects; thus the numbers are
originally ordinal, not cardinal.</p>

<p>The conception of number as cardinal, <i>i.e.</i> as something belonging
to a group of objects as a whole, is a comparatively late one,
and does not arise until the idea of a whole consisting of its parts
has been formed. This is the <i>quantitative</i> aspect of number.</p>

<p>The development from the name-series to the quantitative
conception is aided by the numbering of material objects and
the performance of elementary processes of comparison, addition,
&amp;c., with them. It may also be aided, to a certain extent, by the
tendency to find rhythms in sequences of sounds. This tendency
is common in adults as well as in children; the strokes of a clock
may, for instance, be grouped into fours, and thus eleven is
represented as two fours and three. Finger-counting is of course
natural to children, and leads to grouping into fives, and ultimately
to an understanding of the denary system of notation.</p>

<p>26. <i>Representation of Geometrical Magnitude by Number.</i>&mdash;The
application of arithmetical methods to geometrical measurement
presents some difficulty. In reality there is a transition
from a cardinal to an ordinal system, but to an ordinal system
which does not agree with the original ordinal system from which
the cardinal system was derived. To see this, we may represent
ordinal numbers by the ordinary numerals 1, 2, 3, ... and
cardinal numbers by the Roman I, II, III, ... Then in the
earliest stage each object counted is indivisible; either we are
counting it as a whole, or we are not counting it at all. The symbols 1, 2, 3, ...
then refer to the individual objects, as in fig. 1; this is the primary
ordinal stage. Figs. 2 and 3 represent the cardinal stage; fig. 2
showing how the I, II, III, ... denote the successively larger
groups of objects, while fig. 3 shows how the name II of the
whole is determined by the name 2 of the last one counted.</p>

<table class="nobctr" summary="Illustration">
<tr><td class="figcenter"><img style="width:183px; height:121px" src="images/img528b.jpg" alt="" /></td>

<tr><td class="caption"><span class="sc">Fig.</span> 2.</td>
<td class="caption"><span class="sc">Fig.</span> 3.</td></tr></table>

<p>When now we pass to geometrical measurement, each &ldquo;one&rdquo;
is a thing which is itself divisible, and it cannot be said that at
any moment we are counting it; it is only when one is completed
that we can count it. The names 1, 2, 3, ... for the individual
objects cease to have an intelligible meaning, and measurement
is effected by the cardinal numbers I, II, III, ..., as in fig. 4.
These cardinal numbers have now, however, come to denote
individual points in the line of measurement, <i>i.e.</i> the points of
separation of the individual units of length. The point III in fig. 4
does not include the point II in the same way that the number
III includes the number II in fig. 2, and the points must therefore
be denoted by the ordinal numbers 1, 2, 3, ... as in fig. 5,
the zero 0 falling into its natural place immediately before the
commencement of the first unit.</p>

<p>Thus, while arithmetical numbering refers to units, geometrical
numbering does not refer to units but to the intervals between
units.</p>

<p class="pt2 center sc">III. Arithmetic of Integral Numbers</p>
<p class="center">(i.) <i>Preliminary</i></p>

<p>27. <i>Equality and Identity.</i>&mdash;There is a certain difference
between the use of words referring to equality and identity in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page529" id="page529"></a>529</span>
arithmetic and in algebra respectively; what is an <i>equality</i> in
the former becoming an <i>identity</i> in the latter. Thus the statement
that 4 times 3 is equal to 3 times 4, or, in abbreviated form,
4 × 3 = 3 × 4 (§ 28), is a statement not of identity but of equality;
<i>i.e.</i> 4 × 3 and 3 × 4 mean different things, but the operations
which they denote produce the same result. But in algebra a × b = b × a
is called an identity, in the sense that it is true whatever a
and b may be; while n × X = A is called an equation, as being
true, when n and A are given, for one value only of X. Similarly
the numbers represented by <span class="spp">6</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">12</span> and ½ are not identical, but are
equal.</p>

<p>28. <i>Symbols of Operation.</i>&mdash;The failure to observe the
distinction between an identity and an equality often leads to loose
reasoning; and in order to prevent this it is important that
definite meanings should be attached to all symbols of operation,
and especially to those which represent elementary operations.
The symbols &minus; and ÷ mean respectively that the first quantity
mentioned is to be reduced or divided by the second; but there
is some vagueness about + and ×. In the present article a + b
will mean that a is taken first, and b added to it; but a × b will
mean that b is taken first, and is then multiplied by a. In the
case of numbers the × may be replaced by a dot; thus 4·3
means 4 times 3. When it is necessary to write the multiplicand
before the multiplier, the symbol <span class="f150"><b>×</b></span> will be used, so that
b <span class="f150"><b>×</b></span> a will mean the same as a × b.</p>

<p>29. <i>Axioms.</i>&mdash;There are certain statements that are
sometimes regarded as axiomatic; <i>e.g.</i> that if equals are added to
equals the results are equal, or that if A is greater than B then
A + X is greater than B + X. Such statements, however, are
capable of logical proof, and are generalizations of results obtained
empirically at an elementary stage; they therefore belong more
properly to the laws of arithmetic (§ 58).</p>

<p class="pt1 center">(ii.) <i>Sums and Differences.</i></p>

<p>30. <i>Addition and Subtraction.</i>&mdash;<i>Addition</i> is the process of
expressing (in numeration or notation) a whole, the parts of which
have already been expressed; while, if a whole has been expressed
and also a part or parts, <i>subtraction</i> is the process of expressing
the remainder.</p>

<p>Except with very small numbers, addition and subtraction,
on the grouping system, involve analysis and rearrangement.
Thus the sum of 8 and 7 cannot be expressed as ones; we can
either form the whole, and regroup it as 10 and 5, or we can split
up the 7 into 2 and 5, and add the 2 to the 8 to form 10, thus
getting 8 + 7 = 8 + (2 + 5) = (8 + 2) + 5 = 10 + 5 = 15. For larger
numbers the rearrangement is more extensive; thus
24 + 31 = (20 + 4) + (30 + 1) = (20 + 30) + (4 + 1) = 50 + 5 = 55, the process being
still more complicated when the ones together make more
than ten. Similarly we cannot subtract 8 from 15, if 15 means
1 ten + 5 ones; we must either write
15 &minus; 8 = (10 + 5) &minus; 8 = (10 &minus; 8) + 5 = 2 + 5 = 7,
or else resolve the 15 into an inexpressible
number of ones, and then subtract 8 of them, leaving 7.</p>

<p>Numerical quantities, to be added or subtracted, must be in
the same denomination; we cannot, for instance, add 55 shillings
and 100 pence, any more than we can add 3 yards and 2 metres.</p>

<p>31. <i>Relative Position in the Series.</i>&mdash;The above method of
dealing with addition and subtraction is synthetic, and is
appropriate to the grouping method of dealing with number.
We commence with processes, and see what they lead to; and
thus get an idea of sums and differences. If we adopted the
counting method, we should proceed in a different way, our
method being analytic.</p>

<p>One number is less or greater than another, according as the
symbol (or ordinal) of the former comes earlier or later than that
of the latter in the number-series. Thus (writing ordinals in
light type, and cardinals in heavy type) 9 comes after 4, and
therefore <b>9</b> is greater than <b>4</b>. To find how much greater, we
compare two series, in one of which we go up to 9, while in
the other we stop at 4 and then recommence our counting. The
series are shown below, the numbers being placed horizontally
for convenience of printing, instead of vertically (§ 14):&mdash;</p>

<table class="nobctr" style="width: 70%;" summary="Contents">
<tr><td>1</td> <td>2</td> <td>3</td> <td>4</td> <td>5</td> <td>6</td> <td>7</td> <td>8</td> <td>9</td></tr>
<tr><td>1</td> <td>2</td> <td>3</td> <td>4</td> <td>1</td> <td>2</td> <td>3</td> <td>4</td> <td>5</td></tr>
</table>

<p class="noind">This exhibits <b>9</b> as the sum of <b>4</b> and <b>5</b>; it being understood that
the sum of <b>4</b> and <b>5</b> means that we add <b>5</b> to <b>4</b>. That this gives
the same result as adding <b>4</b> to <b>5</b> may be seen by reckoning the
series backwards.</p>

<p>It is convenient to introduce the zero; thus</p>

<table class="nobctr" style="width: 70%;" summary="Contents">
<tr><td>0</td> <td>1</td> <td>2</td> <td>3</td> <td>4</td> <td>5</td> <td>6</td> <td>7</td> <td>8</td> <td>9</td></tr>
<tr><td>&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>0</td> <td>1</td> <td>2</td> <td>3</td> <td>4</td> <td>5</td></tr>
</table>

<p class="noind">indicates that after getting to 4 we make a fresh start from 4
as our zero.</p>

<p>To subtract, we may proceed in either of two ways. The
subtraction of <b>4</b> from <b>9</b> may mean either &ldquo;What has to be added
to <b>4</b> in order to make up a total of <b>9</b>,&rdquo; or &ldquo;To what has <b>4</b> to be
added in order to make up a total of <b>9</b>.&rdquo; For the former meaning
we count forwards, till we get to 4, and then make a new count,
parallel with the continuation of the old series, and see at what
number we arrive when we get to 9. This corresponds to the
concrete method, in which we have <b>9</b> objects, take away <b>4</b> of
them, and recount the remainder. The alternative method is to
retrace the steps of addition, <i>i.e.</i> to count backwards, treating
9 of one (the standard) series as corresponding with 4 of the other,
and finding which number of the former corresponds with 0 of
the latter. This is a more advanced method, which leads easily
to the idea of negative quantities, if the subtraction is such that
we have to go behind the 0 of the standard series.</p>

<p>32. <i>Mixed Quantities.</i>&mdash;The application of the above principles,
and of similar principles with regard to multiplication and
division, to numerical quantities expressed in any of the diverse
British denominations, presents no theoretical difficulty if the
successive denominations are regarded as constituting a varying
scale of notation (§17). Thus the expression 2 ft. 3 in. implies
that in counting inches we use 0 to eleven instead of 0 to 9
as our first repeating series, so that we put down 1 for the next
denomination when we get to twelve instead of when we get to
ten. Similarly 3 yds. 2 ft. means</p>

<table class="nobctr" style="width: 70%;" summary="Contents">
<tr><td class="tcl">yds.</td> <td>0</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>1</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>2</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>3</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;</td></tr>
<tr><td class="tcl">ft.</td> <td>0</td> <td>1</td> <td>2</td> <td>0</td> <td>1</td> <td>2</td> <td>0</td> <td>1</td> <td>2</td> <td>0</td> <td>1</td> <td>2</td></tr>
</table>

<p class="noind">The practical difficulty, of course, is that the addition of two
numbers produces different results according to the scale in
which we are for the moment proceeding; thus the sum of 9 and
8 is 17, 15, 13 or 11 according as we are dealing with shillings,
pence, pounds (avoirdupois) or ounces. The difficulty may be
minimized by using the notation explained in § 17.</p>

<p class="center pt1">(iii.) <i>Multiples, Submultiples and Quotients.</i></p>

<p>33. <i>Multiplication</i> and <i>Division</i> are the names given to certain
numerical processes which have to be performed in order to
find the result of certain arithmetical operations. Each process
may arise out of either of two distinct operations; but the
terminology is based on the processes, not on the operations
to which they belong, and the latter are not always clearly
understood.</p>

<p>34. <i>Repetition and Subdivision.</i>&mdash;<i>Multiplication</i> occurs when a
certain number or numerical quantity is treated as a <i>unit</i> (§ 11),
and is taken a certain <i>number</i> of times. It therefore arises in one
or other of two ways, according as the unit or the number exists
first in consciousness. If pennies are arranged in groups of five,
the total amounts arranged are successively once 5d., twice 5d.,
three times 5d., ... ; which are written 1 × 5d., 2 × 5d., 3 × 5d., ... (§ 28).
This process is <i>repetition</i>, and the quantities 1 × 5d.,
2 × 5d., 3 × 5d., ... are the successive <i>multiples</i> of 5d. If, on
the other hand, we have a sum of 5s., and treat a shilling as being
equivalent to twelve pence, the 5s. is equivalent to 5 × 12d.;
here the multiplication arises out of a <i>subdivision</i> of the original
unit 1s. into 12d.</p>

<p>Although multiplication may arise in either of these two ways,
the actual process in each case is performed by commencing with
the unit and taking it the necessary number of times. In the
above case of subdivision, for instance, each of the 5 shillings is
separately converted into pence, so that we do in fact find in
succession once 12d., twice 12d., ...; <i>i.e.</i> we find the multiples
of 12d. up to 5 times.</p>

<p>The result of the multiplication is called the <i>product</i> of the unit
by the number of times it is taken.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page530" id="page530"></a>530</span></p>

<p>35. <i>Diagram of Multiplication.</i>&mdash;The process of multiplication
is performed in order to obtain such results as the following:&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">If 1 boy receives 7 apples,<br />
  then 3 boys receive 21 apples;</p>

<p class="noind">or</p>

<p class="center">If 1s. is equivalent to 12d.,<br />
  then 5s. is equivalent to 60d.</p>

<p>The essential portions of these statements, from the arithmetical
point of view, may be exhibited in the form of the
diagrams A and B:&mdash;</p>

<div class="center ptb1"><img style="width:494px; height:130px" src="images/img530a.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p class="noind">or more briefly, as in C or C&prime; and D or D&prime;:&mdash;</p>

<div class="center ptb1"><img style="width:525px; height:129px" src="images/img530b.jpg" alt="" /></div>

or E&prime;:&mdash;</p>

<div class="center ptb1"><img style="width:465px; height:134px" src="images/img530c.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p class="noind">Multiplication is therefore equivalent to completion of the
diagram by entry of the product.</p>

<p>36. <i>Multiple-Tables.</i>&mdash;The diagram C or D of § 35 is part of a
complete table giving the successive multiples of the particular
unit. If we take several different units, and write down their
successive multiples in parallel columns, preceded by the number-series,
we obtain a <i>multiple-table</i> such as the following:&mdash;</p>

<p class="noind">It is to be considered that each column may extend downwards
indefinitely.</p>

<p>37. <i>Successive Multiplication.</i>&mdash;In multiplication by repetition
the unit is itself usually a multiple of some other unit, <i>i.e.</i> it is a
product which is taken as a new unit. When this new unit has
been multiplied by a number, we can again take the product as
a unit for the purpose of another multiplication; and so on
indefinitely. Similarly where multiplication has arisen out of the
subdivision of a unit into smaller units, we can again subdivide
these smaller units. Thus we get successive multiplication; but
it represents quite different operations according as it is due to
repetition, in the sense of § 34, or to subdivision, and these
operations will be exhibited by different diagrams. Of the two
diagrams below, A exhibits the successive multiplication of £3 by
20, 12 and 4, and B the successive reduction of £3 to shillings,
pence and farthings. The principle on which the diagrams are
constructed is obvious from § 35. It should be noticed that in
multiplying £3 by 20 we find the value of 20·3, but that in
reducing £3 to shillings, since each £ becomes 20s., we find the
value of 3·20.</p>

<div class="center ptb1"><img style="width:483px; height:237px" src="images/img530d.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p>38. <i>Submultiples.</i>&mdash;The relation of a unit to its successive
multiples as shown in a multiple-table is expressed by saying
that it is a submultiple of the multiples, the successive
submultiples being <i>one-half, one-third, one-fourth</i>, ... Thus, in the
diagram of § 36, 1s. 5d. is one-half of 2s. 10d., one-third of 4s. 3d.,
one-fourth of 5s. 8d., ...; these being written &ldquo;½ of 2s. 10d.,&rdquo;
&ldquo;<span class="spp">1</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">3</span> of 4s. 3d.,&rdquo; &ldquo;¼ of 5s. 8d,&rdquo;...</p>

<p>The relation of submultiple is the converse of that of multiple;
thus if a is <span class="spp">1</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">5</span> of b, then b is 5 times a. The determination of a
submultiple is therefore equivalent to completion of the diagram E
or E&prime; of § 35 by entry of the unit, when the number of times it is
taken, and the product, are given. The operation is the converse
of repetition; it is usually called <i>partition</i>, as representing division
into a number of equal shares.</p>

<p>39. <i>Quotients.</i>&mdash;The converse of subdivision is the formation
of units into groups, each constituting a larger unit; the number
of the groups so formed out of a definite number of the original
units is called a <i>quotient</i>. The determination of a quotient is
equivalent to completion of the diagram by entry of the number
when the unit and the product are given. There is no satisfactory
name for the operation, as distinguished from partition; it is
sometimes called measuring, but this implies an equality in
the original units, which is not an essential feature of the
operation.</p>

<p>40. <i>Division.</i>&mdash;From the commutative law for multiplication,
which shows that 3 × 4d. = 4 × 3d. = 12d., it follows that the
number of pence in one-fourth of 12d. is equal to the quotient
when 12 pence are formed into units of 4d.; each of these numbers
being said to be obtained by <i>dividing</i> 12 by 4. The term <i>division</i>
is therefore used in text-books to describe the two processes
described in §§ 38 and 39; the product mentioned in § 34 is the
<i>dividend</i>, the number or the unit, whichever is given, is called the
<i>divisor</i>, and the unit or number which is to be found is called the
<i>quotient</i>. The symbol ÷ is used to denote both kinds of division;
thus A ÷ n denotes the unit, n of which make up A, and A ÷ B
denotes the number of times that B has to be taken to make up A.
In the present article this confusion is avoided by writing the
former as <span class="spp">1</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">n</span> of A.</p>

<p>Methods of division are considered later (§§ 106-108).</p>

<p>41. <i>Diagrams of Division.</i>&mdash;Since we write from left to right
or downwards, it may be convenient for division to interchange
the rows or the columns of the multiplication-diagram. Thus the
uncompleted diagram for partition is F or G, while for measuring
it is usually H; the vacant compartment being for the unit in
F or G, and for the number in H. In some cases it may be convenient
in measuring to show both the units, as in K.</p>

<div class="center ptb1"><img style="width:521px; height:134px" src="images/img530e.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p>43. <i>Powers, Roots and Logarithms.</i>&mdash;The standard series 1, 2,
3, ... is obtained by successive additions of 1 to the number last
found. If instead of commencing with 1 and making successive
additions of 1 we commence with any number such as 3 and make
successive multiplications by 3, we get a series 3, 9, 27, ... as
shown below the line in the margin. The first member
of the series is 3; the second is the product of
two numbers, each equal to 3; the third is the product
of three numbers, each equal to 3; and so on.
These are written 3<span class="sp">1</span> (or 3), 3<span class="sp">2</span>, 3<span class="sp">3</span>, 3<span class="sp">4</span>, ... where
n<span class="sp">p</span> denotes the product of p numbers, each equal to
n. If we write n<span class="sp">p</span> = N, then, if any two of the three
numbers n, p, N are known, the third is determinate.
If we know n and p, p is called the <i>index</i>, and n, n<span class="sp">2</span>, ... n<span class="sp">p</span>
are called the <i>first power, second power, ... pth power</i> of n, the
series itself being called the <i>power-series</i>. The <i>second power</i> and
<i>third power</i> are usually called the <i>square</i> and <i>cube</i> respectively.
If we know p and N, n is called the <i>pth root</i> of N, so that n is the
<i>second</i> (or <i>square</i>) <i>root</i> of n<span class="sp">2</span>, the <i>third</i> (or <i>cube</i>) <i>root</i> of n<span class="sp">3</span>, the
<i>fourth root</i> of n<span class="sp">4</span>, ... If we know n and N, then p is the <i>logarithm</i>
of N to <i>base</i> n.</p>

<p>The calculation of powers (<i>i.e.</i> of N when n and p are given) is
<i>involution</i>; the calculation of roots (<i>i.e.</i> of n when p and N are
given) is <i>evolution</i>; the calculation of logarithms (<i>i.e.</i> of p when n
and N are given) has no special name.</p>

<p>Involution is a direct process, consisting of successive multiplications;
the other two are inverse processes. The calculation of
a logarithm can be performed by successive divisions; evolution
requires special methods.</p>

<p>The above definitions of logarithms, &amp;c., relate to cases in which
n and p are whole numbers, and are generalized later.</p>

<p>44. <i>Law of Indices.</i>&mdash;If we multiply n<span class="sp">p</span> by n<span class="sp">q</span>, we multiply the
product of p n&rsquo;s by the product of q n&rsquo;s, and the result is therefore
n<span class="sp">p + q</span>. Similarly, if we divide n<span class="sp">p</span> by n<span class="sp">q</span>, where q is less than p,
the result is n<span class="sp">p &minus; q</span>. Thus multiplication and division in the
power-series correspond to addition and subtraction in the
index-series, and vice versa.</p>

<p>If we divide n<span class="sp">p</span> by n<span class="sp">p</span>, the quotient is of course 1. This should
be written n<span class="sp">0</span>. Thus we may make the power-series commence
with 1, if we make the index-series commence with 0. The added
terms are shown above the line in the diagram in § 43.</p>

<p>45. <i>Factors, Primes and Prime Factors.</i>&mdash;If we take the successive
multiples of 2, 3, ...
as in § 36, and place each
multiple opposite the same
number in the original series,
we get an arrangement as
in the adjoining diagram. If
any number N occurs in the
vertical series commencing
with a number n (other than
1) then n is said to be a <i>factor</i>
of N. Thus 2, 3 and 6 are
factors of 6; and 2, 3, 4, 6
and 12 are factors of 12.</p>

</table>

<p>A number (other than 1) which has no factor except itself is
called a <i>prime number</i>, or, more briefly, a <i>prime</i>. Thus 2, 3, 5, 7
and 11 are primes, for each of these occurs twice only in the table.
A number (other than 1) which is not a prime number is called a
<i>composite</i> number.</p>

<p>If a number is a factor of another number, it is a factor of any
multiple of that number. Hence, if a number has factors, one at
least of these must be a prime. Thus 12 has 6 for a factor; but
6 is not a prime, one of its factors being 2; and therefore 2 must
also be a factor of 12. Dividing 12 by 2, we get a submultiple 6,
which again has a prime 2 as a factor. Thus any number which
is not itself a prime is the product of several factors, each of which
is a prime, <i>e.g.</i> 12 is the product of 2, 2 and 3. These are called
<i>prime factors</i>.</p>

<p>The following are the most important properties of numbers in
reference to factors:&mdash;</p>

<p>(i) If a number is a factor of another number, it is a factor of any
multiple of that number.</p>

<p>(ii) If a number is a factor of two numbers, it is a factor of their
sum or (if they are unequal) of their difference. (The words in
brackets are inserted to avoid the difficulty, at this stage, of
saying that every number is a factor of 0, though it is of course
true that 0·n = 0, whatever n may be.)</p>

<p>(iii) A number can be resolved into prime factors in one way
only, no account being taken of their relative order. Thus
12 = 2 × 2 × 3 = 2 × 3 × 2 = 3 × 2 × 2, but this is regarded as one
way only. If any prime occurs more than once, it is usual to
write the number of times of occurrence as an index; thus
144 = 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 3 × 3 = 2<span class="sp">4</span>·3<span class="sp">2</span>.</p>

<p>The number 1 is usually included amongst the primes; but, if
this is done, the last paragraph requires modification, since 144
could be expressed as 1·2<span class="sp">4</span>·3<span class="sp">2</span>, or as 1<span class="sp">2</span>·2<span class="sp">4</span>·3<span class="sp">2</span>,
or as 1<span class="sp">p</span>·2<span class="sp">4</span>·3<span class="sp">2</span>, where p might be anything.</p>

<p>If two numbers have no factor in common (except 1) each is
said to be <i>prime to</i> the other.</p>

<p>The multiples of 2 (including 1·2) are called <i>even</i> numbers;
other numbers are <i>odd</i> numbers.</p>

<p>46. <i>Greatest Common Divisor.</i>&mdash;If we resolve two numbers into
their prime factors, we can find their <i>Greatest Common Divisor</i> or
<i>Highest Common Factor</i> (written G.C.D. or G.C.F. or H.C.F.),
<i>i.e.</i> the greatest number which is a factor of both. Thus
144 = 2<span class="sp">4</span>·3<span class="sp">2</span>, and 756 = 2<span class="sp">2</span>·3<span class="sp">3</span>·7, and therefore the G.C.D. of 144
and 756 is 2<span class="sp">2</span>·3<span class="sp">2</span> = 36. If we require the G.C.D. of two numbers,
and cannot resolve them into their prime factors, we use a process
described in the text-books. The process depends on (ii)
of § 45, in the extended form that, if x is a factor of a and b, it is
a factor of pa &minus; qb, where p and q are any integers.</p>

<p>The G.C.D. of three or more numbers is found in the same way.</p>

<p>47. <i>Least Common Multiple.</i>&mdash;The <i>Least Common Multiple</i>, or
L.C.M., of two numbers, is the least number of which they are
both factors. Thus, since 144 = 2<span class="sp">4</span>·3<span class="sp">2</span>, and 756 = 2<span class="sp">2</span>·3<span class="sp">3</span>·7, the
L.C.M. of 144 and 756 is 2<span class="sp">4</span>·3<span class="sp">3</span>·7. It is clear, from comparison
with the last paragraph, that the product of the G.C.D. and the
L.C.M. of two numbers is equal to the product of the numbers
themselves. This gives a rule for finding the L.C.M. of two
numbers. But we cannot apply it to finding the L.C.M. of three
or more numbers; if we cannot resolve the numbers into their
prime factors, we must find the L.C.M. of the first two, then the
L.C.M. of this and the next number, and so on.</p>

<p class="center pt1">(B) Properties depending on the Scale of Notation.</p>

<p>48. <i>Tests of Divisibility.</i>&mdash;The following are the principal rules
for testing whether particular numbers are factors of a given
number. The number is divisible&mdash;</p>

<p>(i) by 10 if it ends in 0;</p>

<p>(ii) by 5 if it ends in 0 or 5;</p>

<p>(iii) by 2 if the last digit is even;</p>

<p>(iv) by 4 if the number made up of the last two digits is
divisible by 4;</p>

<p>(v) by 8 if the number made up of the last three digits is
divisible by 8;</p>

<p>(vi) by 9 if the sum of the digits is divisible by 9;</p>

<p>(vii) by 3 if the sum of the digits is divisible by 3;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page532" id="page532"></a>532</span></p>

<p>(viii) by 11 if the difference between the sum of the 1st, 3rd,
5th, ... digits and the sum of the 2nd, 4th, 6th, ... is zero or
divisible by 11.</p>

<p>(ix) To find whether a number is divisible by 7, 11 or 13,
arrange the number in groups of three figures, beginning from the
end, treat each group as a separate number, and then find the
difference between the sum of the 1st, 3rd, ... of these numbers
and the sum of the 2nd, 4th, ... Then, if this difference is
zero or is divisible by 7, 11 or 13, the original number is also so
divisible; and conversely. For example, 31521 gives 521 &minus; 31 = 490,
and therefore is divisible by 7, but not by 11 or 13.</p>

<p>49. <i>Casting out Nines</i> is a process based on (vi) of the last
paragraph. The remainder when a number is divided by 9 is
equal to the remainder when the sum of its digits is divided by 9.
Also, if the remainders when two numbers are divided by 9 are
respectively a and b, the remainder when their product is divided
by 9 is the same as the remainder when a·b is divided by 9. This
gives a rule for testing multiplication, which is found in most
text-books. It is doubtful, however, whether such a rule, giving
a test which is necessarily incomplete, is of much educational
value.</p>

<p class="center pt1">(v.) <i>Relative Magnitude.</i></p>

<p>50. <i>Fractions.</i>&mdash;A <i>fraction</i> of a quantity is a submultiple, or a
multiple of a submultiple, of that quantity. Thus, since
3 × 1s. 5d. = 4s. 3d., 1s. 5d. may be denoted by <span class="spp">1</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">3</span> of 4s. 3d.; and
any multiple of 1s. 5d., denoted by n × 1s. 5d., may also be
denoted by n/3 of 4s. 3d. We therefore use &ldquo;<span class="spp">n</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">a</span> of A&rdquo; to mean that
we find a quantity X such that a × X = A, and then multiply
X by n.</p>

<p>It must be noted (i) that this is a definition of &ldquo;n/a of,&rdquo; not a
definition of &ldquo;n/a,&rdquo; and (ii) that it is not necessary that n should be
less than a.</p>

<p>51. <i>Subdivision of Submultiple.</i>&mdash;By <span class="spp">5</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">7</span> of A we mean 5 times the
unit, 7 times which is A. If we regard this unit as being 4 times
a lesser unit, then A is 7·4 times this lesser unit, and <span class="spp">5</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">7</span> of A is 5·4
times the lesser unit. Hence <span class="spp">5</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">7</span> of A is equal to <span class="spp">5·4</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">7·4</span> of A; and,
conversely, <span class="spp">5·4</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">7·4</span> of A is equal to <span class="spp">5</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">7</span> of A. Similarly each of
these is equal to <span class="spp">5·3</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">7·3</span> of A. Hence the value of a fraction is not
altered by substituting for the numerator and denominator the
corresponding numbers in any other column of a multiple-table
(§ 36). If we write <span class="spp">5·4</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">7·4</span> in the form <span class="spp">4·5</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">4·7</span> we may say that the
value of a fraction is not altered by multiplying or dividing the
numerator and denominator by any number.</p>

<p>52. <i>Fraction of a Fraction.</i>&mdash;To find <span class="spp">11</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">4</span> of <span class="spp">5</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">7</span> of A we must
convert <span class="spp">5</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">7</span> of A into 4 times some unit. This is done by the preceding
paragraph. For <span class="spp">5</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">7</span> of A = <span class="spp">5·4</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">7·4</span> of A = <span class="spp">4·5</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">7·4</span> of A; <i>i.e.</i> it is
4 times a unit which is itself 5 times another unit, 7·4 times, which
is A. Hence, taking the former unit 11 times instead of 4 times,</p>

<table class="math0" summary="math">
<tr><td rowspan="2"><span class="spp">11</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">4</span> of <span class="spp">5</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">7</span> of A =</td> <td>11·5</td>
<td rowspan="2">of A</td></tr>
<tr><td class="denom">7·4</td></tr></table>

<p>A fraction of a fraction is sometimes called a <i>compound
fraction.</i></p>

<p>53. <i>Comparison, Addition and Subtraction of Fractions.</i>&mdash;The
quantities ¾ of A and <span class="spp">5</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">7</span> of A are expressed in terms of different
units. To compare them, or to add or subtract them, we must
express them in terms of the same unit. Thus, taking <span class="spp">1</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">28</span> of A
as the unit, we have (§ 51)</p>

<p class="center">¾ of A = <span class="spp">21</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">28</span> of A; <span class="spp">5</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">7</span> of A = <span class="spp">20</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">28</span> of A.</p>

<p class="noind">Hence the former is greater than the latter; their sum is <span class="spp">41</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">28</span> of A;
and their difference is <span class="spp">1</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">28</span> of A.</p>

<p>Thus the fractions must be reduced to a <i>common denominator</i>.
This denominator must, if the fractions are in their lowest terms
(§ 54), be a multiple of each of the denominators; it is usually
most convenient that it should be their L.C.M. (§ 47).</p>

<p>54. <i>Fraction in its Lowest Terms.</i>&mdash;A fraction is said to be <i>in its
lowest terms</i> when its numerator and denominator have no common
factor; or to be reduced to its lowest terms when it is replaced by
such a fraction. Thus <span class="spp">8</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">22</span> of A is said to be reduced to its lowest
terms when it is replaced by <span class="spp">4</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">11</span> of A. It is important always to
bear in mind that <span class="spp">4</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">11</span> of A is not the <i>same</i> as <span class="spp">8</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">22</span> of A, though
it is <i>equal</i> to it.</p>

<p>55. <i>Diagram of Fractional Relation.</i>&mdash;To find <span class="spp">10</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">24</span> of 14s. we have
to take 10 of the units, 24 of which make up 14s. Hence the
required amount will, in the multiple-table of
§ 36, be opposite 10 in the column in which
the amount opposite 24 is 14s.; the quantity
at the head of this column, representing the
unit, will be found to be 7d. The elements
of the multiple-table with which we are
concerned are shown in the diagram in the
margin. This diagram serves equally for
the two statements that (i) <span class="spp">10</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">24</span> of 14s. is
5s. 10d., (ii) <span class="spp">24</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">10</span> of 5s. 10d. is 14s. The two statements are in fact
merely different aspects of a single relation, considered in the
next section.</p>

<p>56. <i>Ratio.</i>&mdash;If we omit the two upper compartments of the
diagram in the last section, we obtain the diagram A. This
diagram exhibits a relation between the two
amounts 5s. 10d. and 14s. on the one hand,
and the numbers 10 and 24 of the standard
series on the other, which is expressed by saying
that 5s. 10d. is to 14s. in the <i>ratio</i> of 10
to 24, or that 14s. is to 5s. 10d. in the ratio of
24 to 10. If we had taken 1s. 2d. instead of
7d. as the unit for the second column, we
should have obtained the diagram B. Thus
we must regard the ratio of a to b as being
the same as the ratio of c to d, if the fractions
a/b and c/d are equal. For this reason the
ratio of a to b is sometimes written a/b, but
the more correct method is to write it a:b.</p>

<p>If two quantities or numbers P and Q are to each other in the
ratio of p to q, it is clear from the diagram that
p times Q = q times P, so that Q = q/p of P.</p>

<p>57. <i>Proportion.</i>&mdash;If from any two columns in the table of § 36
we remove the numbers or quantities in any two rows, we get
a diagram such as that here shown.
The pair of compartments on either
side may, as here, contain numerical
quantities, or may contain numbers.
But the two pairs of compartments
will correspond to a single pair of
numbers, <i>e.g.</i> 2 and 6, in the standard series, so that, denoting
them by M, N and P, Q respectively, M will be to N in the same
ratio that P is to Q.
This is expressed by saying
that M is to N as P to Q, the relation being written
M:N :: P:Q; the four quantities are then said
to be <i>in proportion</i> or to be <i>proportionals</i>.</p>

<p>This is the most general expression of the
relative magnitude of two quantities; <i>i.e.</i> the
relation expressed by proportion includes the relations expressed
by multiple, submultiple, fraction and ratio.</p>

<p>If M and N are respectively m and n times a unit, and P and Q
are respectively p and q times a unit, then the quantities are in
proportion if mq = np; and conversely.</p>

<p class="pt1 center sc">IV. Laws of Arithmetic</p>

<p>58. <i>Laws of Arithmetic.</i>&mdash;The arithmetical processes which we
have considered in reference to positive integral numbers are
subject to the following laws:&mdash;</p>

<p>(i) <i>Equalities and Inequalities.</i>&mdash;The following are sometimes
called <i>Axioms</i> (§ 29), but their truth should be proved, even if at
an early stage it is assumed. The symbols &ldquo;&gt;&rdquo; and &ldquo;&lt;&rdquo;
mean respectively &ldquo;is greater than&rdquo; and &ldquo;is less than.&rdquo; The
numbers represented by a, b, c, x and m are all supposed to be
positive.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page533" id="page533"></a>533</span></p>

<div class="list">
<p>(a) If a = b, and b = c. then a = c;</p>
<p>(b) If a = b, then a + x = b + x, and a &minus; x = b &minus; x;</p>
<p>(c) If a &gt; b, then a + x &gt; b + x, and a &minus; x &gt; b &minus; x;</p>
<p>(d) If a &lt; b, then a + b &lt; b + x, and a &minus; x &lt; b &minus; x;</p>
<p>(e) If a = b, then ma = mb, and a ÷ m = b ÷ m;</p>
<p>(f) If a &gt; b, then ma &gt; mb, and a ÷ m &gt; b ÷ m;</p>
<p>(g) If a &lt; b, then ma &lt; mb, and a ÷ m &lt; b ÷ m.</p>
</div>

<p>(ii) <i>Associative Law for Additions and Subtractions.</i>&mdash;This law
includes the <i>rule of signs</i>, that a &minus; (b &minus; c) = a &minus; b + c; and it states
that, subject to this, successive operations of addition or subtraction
may be grouped in sets in any way; <i>e.g.</i> a &minus; b + c + d + e &minus; f
= a &minus; (b &minus; c) + (d + e &minus; f).</p>

<p>(iii) <i>Commutative Law for Additions and Subtractions</i>, that
additions and subtractions may be performed in any order; <i>e.g.</i>
a &minus; b + c + d = a + c &minus; b + d = a &minus; b + c &minus; b.</p>

<p>(iv) <i>Associative Law for Multiplications and Divisions.</i>&mdash;This
law includes a rule, similar to the rule of signs, to the effect that
a ÷ (b ÷ c) = a ÷ b <span class="f150"><b>×</b></span> c; and it states that, subject to this, successive
operations of multiplication or division may be grouped in sets in
any way; <i>e.g.</i> a ÷ b <span class="f150"><b>×</b></span> c <span class="f150"><b>×</b></span> d <span class="f150"><b>×</b></span> e ÷ f = a ÷ (b ÷ c) <span class="f150"><b>×</b></span> (d <span class="f150"><b>×</b></span> e ÷ f).</p>

<p>(v) <i>Commutative Law for Multiplications and Divisions</i>, that
multiplications and divisions may be performed in any order: <i>e.g.</i>
a ÷ b <span class="f150"><b>×</b></span> c <span class="f150"><b>×</b></span> d = a <span class="f150"><b>×</b></span> c ÷ b <span class="f150"><b>×</b></span> d = a <span class="f150"><b>×</b></span> d <span class="f150"><b>×</b></span> c ÷ b.</p>

<p>(vi) <i>Distributive Law</i>, that multiplications and divisions may
be distributed over additions and subtractions, <i>e.g.</i> that
m(a + b &minus; c) = m·a + m·b &minus; m·c, or that (a + b &minus; c) ÷ n = (a ÷ n) + (b ÷ n) + (c ÷ n).</p>

<p>In the case of (ii), (iii) and (vi), the letters a, b, c, ... may
denote either numbers or numerical quantities, while m and n
denote numbers; in the case of (iv) and (v) the letters denote
numbers only.</p>

<p>59. <i>Results of Inverse Operations.</i>&mdash;Addition, multiplication
and involution are direct processes; and, if we start with
positive integers, we continue with positive integers throughout.
But, in attempting the inverse processes of subtraction, division,
and either evolution or determination of index, the data may be
such that a process cannot be performed. We can, however,
denote the result of the process by a symbol, and deal with this
symbol according to the laws of arithmetic. In this way we
arrive at (i) negative numbers, (ii) fractional numbers, (iii) surds,
(iv) logarithms (in the ordinary sense of the word).</p>

<p>60. <i>Simple Formulae.</i>&mdash;The following are some simple
formulae which follow from the laws stated in § 58.</p>

<p>(i) (a + b + c + ...)(p + q + r + ...) = (ap + aq + ar + ...) +
(bp + bq + br + ...) + (cp + cq + cr + ...) + ...; <i>i.e.</i> the product
of two or more numbers, each of which consists of two
or more parts, is the sum of the products of each part of the one
with each part of the other.</p>

<p>(ii) (a + b)(a &minus; b) = a<span class="sp">2</span> &minus; b<span class="sp">2</span>; <i>i.e.</i> the product of the sum and the
difference of two numbers is equal to the difference of their squares.</p>

<p>(in) (a + b)<span class="sp">2</span> = a<span class="sp">2</span> + 2ab + b<span class="sp">2</span> = a<span class="sp">2</span> + (2a + b)b.</p>

<p class="pt2 center sc">V. Negative Numbers</p>

<p>61. <i>Negative Numbers</i> may be regarded as resulting from the
commutative law for addition and subtraction. According to this
law, 10 + 3 + 6 &minus; 7 = 10 + 3 &minus; 7 + 6 = 3 + 6 &minus; 7 + 10 = &amp;c. But, if we
write the expression as 3 &minus; 7 + 6 + 10, this means that we must
first subtract 7 from 3. This cannot be done; but the result of
the subtraction, if it could be done, is something which, when
6 is added to it, becomes 3 &minus; 7 + 6 = 3 + 6 &minus; 7 = 2. The result of
3 &minus; 7 is the same as that of 0 &minus; 4; and we may write it &ldquo;&minus;4,&rdquo;
and call it a <i>negative number</i>, if by this we mean something
possessing the property that &minus;4 + 4 = 0.</p>

<p>This, of course, is unintelligible on the grouping system of
treating number; on the counting system it merely means that
we count backwards from 0, just as we might count inches backwards
from a point marked 0 on a scale. It should be remembered
that the counting is performed with something as unit. If this
unit is A, then what we are really considering is &minus;4A; and this
means, not that A is multiplied by &minus;4, but that A is multiplied
by 4, and the product is taken negatively. It would therefore
be better, in some ways, to retain the unit throughout, and to
describe &minus;4A as a <i>negative quantity</i>, in order to avoid confusion
with the &ldquo;negative numbers&rdquo; with which operations are performed
in formal algebra.</p>

<p>The positive quantity or number obtained from a negative
quantity or number by omitting the &ldquo;&minus;&rdquo; is called its <i>numerical
value</i>.</p>

<p class="pt2 center sc">VI. Fractional and Decimal Numbers</p>

<p>62. <i>Fractional Numbers.</i>&mdash;According to the definition in § 50
the quantity denoted by <span class="spp">3</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">6</span> of A is made up of a number, 3, and a
unit, which is one-sixth of A. Similarly p/n of A, q/n of A, r/n of A, ...
mean quantities which are respectively p times, q times
r times, ... the unit, n of which make up A. Thus any arithmetical
processes which can be applied to the numbers p, q, r,
... can be applied to p/n, q/n, r/n, ... , the denominator n
remaining unaltered.</p>

<p>If we denote the unit 1/n of A by X, then A is n times X, and
p/n of n times X is p times X; <i>i.e.</i> p/n of n times is p times.</p>

<p>Hence, so long as the denominator remains unaltered, we can
deal with p/n, q/n, r/n, ... exactly as if they were numbers, any
operations being performed on the numerators. The expressions
p/n, q/n, r/n, ... are then <i>fractional numbers</i>, their relation to
ordinary or <i>integral</i> numbers being that p/n times n times is equal
to p times.</p>

<table class="nobctr" style="float: right; width: 160px;" summary="Illustration">
<tr><td class="figright1"><img style="width:107px; height:300px" src="images/img533a.jpg" alt="" /></td></tr></table>

<p>This relation is of exactly the same kind as the relation of the
successive digits in numbers expressed in a scale of notation whose
base is n. Hence we can treat the fractional
numbers which have any one denominator as
constituting a number-series, as shown in the
adjoining diagram. The result of taking 13 sixths
of A is then seen to be the same as the result of
taking twice A and one-sixth of A, so that we may
regard <span class="spp">13</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">6</span> as being equal to 2<span class="spp">1</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">6</span>. A fractional
number is called a <i>proper fraction</i> or an <i>improper
fraction</i> according as the numerator is or is not
less than the denominator; and an expression
such as 2<span class="spp">1</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">6</span> is called a mixed number. An improper
fraction is therefore equal either to an
integer or to a mixed number. It will be seen
from § 17 that a mixed number corresponds
with what is there called a <i>mixed quantity</i>.
Thus £3, 17s. is a mixed quantity, being expressed
in pounds and shillings; to express it in terms of pounds
only we must write it £3<span class="spp">17</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">20</span>.</p>

<p class="nom">&nbsp;</p>

<table class="nobctr" style="float: right; width: 240px;" summary="Illustration">
<tr><td class="figright1"><img style="width:187px; height:447px" src="images/img533b.jpg" alt="" /></td></tr></table>

<p>63. <i>Fractional Numbers with different Denominators.</i>&mdash;If we
divided the unit into halves, and these new units into thirds, we
should get sixths of the original unit, as
shown in A; while, if we divided the
unit into thirds, and these new units
into halves, we should again get sixths,
but as shown in B. The series of halves
in the one case, and of thirds in the
other, are entirely different series of
fractional numbers, but we can compare
them by putting each in its proper
position in relation to the series of sixths.
Thus <span class="spp">3</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">2</span> is equal to <span class="spp">9</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">6</span>, and <span class="spp">5</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">3</span> is equal to <span class="spp">10</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">6</span>,
and conversely; in other words, any
fractional number is equivalent to the
fractional number obtained by multiplying
or dividing the numerator and
denominator by any integer. We can
thus find fractional numbers equivalent
to the sum or difference of any two
fractional numbers. The process is the
same as that of finding the sum or difference
of 3 sixpences and 5 fourpences;
we cannot subtract 3 sixpenny-bits
from 5 fourpenny-bits, but we can express
each as an equivalent number of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page534" id="page534"></a>534</span>
pence, and then perform the subtraction. Generally, to find the
sum or difference of two or more fractional numbers, we must
replace them by other fractional numbers having the same
denominator; it is usually most convenient to take as this
denominator the L.C.M. of the original fractional numbers (cf.
§ 53).</p>

<p>64. <i>Complex Fractions.</i>&mdash;A fraction (or fractional number),
the numerator or denominator of which is a fractional number,
is called a <i>complex</i> fraction (or fractional number), to distinguish
it from a <i>simple</i> fraction, which is a fraction having integers for
numerator and denominator. Thus 5<span class="spp">2</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">3</span> / 11<span class="spp">1</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">3</span> of A means that we take
a unit X such that 11<span class="spp">1</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">3</span> times X is equal to A, and then take 5<span class="spp">2</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">3</span>
times X. To simplify this, we take a new unit Y, which is <span class="spp">1</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">3</span> of X.
Then A is 34 times Y, and 5<span class="spp">2</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">3</span> / 11<span class="spp">1</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">3</span> of A is 17 times Y, <i>i.e.</i> it is ½ of A.</p>

<p>65. <i>Multiplication of Fractional Numbers.</i>&mdash;To multiply <span class="spp">8</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">3</span> by <span class="spp">5</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">7</span>
is to take <span class="spp">5</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">7</span> times <span class="spp">8</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">3</span>. It has already been explained (§ 62) that <span class="spp">5</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">7</span>
times is an operation such that <span class="spp">5</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">7</span> times 7 times is equal to 5 times.
Hence we must express <span class="spp">8</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">3</span>, which itself means <span class="spp">8</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">3</span> times, as being
7 times something. This is done by multiplying both numerator
and denominator by 7; <i>i.e.</i> <span class="spp">8</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">3</span> is equal to <span class="spp">7·8</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">7·3</span>, which is the same
thing as 7 times <span class="spp">8</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">7·3</span>. Hence <span class="spp">5</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">7</span> times <span class="spp">8</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">3</span> = <span class="spp">5</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">7</span> times 7 times <span class="spp">8</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">7·3</span>
= 5 times <span class="spp">8</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">7·3</span> = <span class="spp">5·8</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">7·3</span>. The rule for multiplying a fractional number
by a fractional number is therefore the same as the rule for finding
a fraction of a fraction.</p>

<p>66. <i>Division of Fractional Numbers.</i>&mdash;To divide <span class="spp">8</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">3</span> by <span class="spp">5</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">7</span> is to
find a number (<i>i.e.</i> a fractional number) x such that <span class="spp">5</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">7</span> times x is
equal to <span class="spp">8</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">3</span>. But <span class="spp">7</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">5</span> times <span class="spp">5</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">7</span> times x is, by the last section, equal to
x. Hence x is equal to <span class="spp">7</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">5</span> times <span class="spp">8</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">3</span>. Thus to divide by a fractional
number we must multiply by the number obtained by interchanging
the numerator and the denominator, <i>i.e.</i> by the <i>reciprocal</i>
of the original number.</p>

<p>If we divide 1 by <span class="spp">5</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">7</span> we obtain, by this rule, <span class="spp">7</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">5</span>. Thus the
reciprocal of a number may be defined as the number obtained
by dividing 1 by it. This definition applies whether the original
number is integral or fractional.</p>

<p>By means of the present and the preceding sections the rule
given in § 63 can be extended to the statement that a fractional
number is equal to the number obtained by multiplying its
numerator and its denominator by any fractional number.</p>

<p>67. <i>Negative Fractional Numbers.</i>&mdash;We can obtain negative
fractional numbers in the same way that we obtain negative
integral numbers; thus &minus; <span class="spp">5</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">7</span> or &minus; <span class="spp">5</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">7</span>A means that <span class="spp">5</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">7</span> or <span class="spp">5</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">7</span>A is taken
negatively.</p>

<p>68. <i>Genesis of Fractional Numbers.</i>&mdash;A fractional number may
be regarded as the result of a measuring division (§ 39) which
cannot be performed exactly. Thus we cannot divide 3 in. by
11 in. exactly, <i>i.e.</i> we cannot express 3 in. as an integral multiple
of 11 in.; but, by extending the meaning of &ldquo;times&rdquo; as in § 62,
we can say that 3 in. is <span class="spp">3</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">11</span> times 11 in., and therefore call <span class="spp">3</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">11</span> the
quotient when 3 in. is divided by 11 in. Hence, if p and n are
numbers, p/n is sometimes regarded as denoting the result of
dividing p by n, whether p and n are integral or fractional
(mixed numbers being included in fractional).</p>

<p>The idea and properties of a fractional number having been
explained, we may now call it, for brevity, a <i>fraction</i>. Thus
&ldquo;<span class="spp">2</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">3</span> of A&rdquo; no longer means two of the units, three of which make
up A; it means that A is multiplied by the fraction <span class="spp">2</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">3</span>, <i>i.e.</i> it
means the same thing as &ldquo;<span class="spp">2</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">3</span> times A.&rdquo;</p>

<p>69. <i>Percentage.</i>&mdash;In order to deal, by way of comparison or
addition or subtraction, with fractions which have different
denominators, it is necessary to reduce them to a common
denominator. To avoid this difficulty, in practical life, it is usual
to confine our operations to fractions which have a certain
standard denominator. Thus (§ 79) the Romans reckoned in
twelfths, and the Babylonians in sixtieths; the former method
supplied a basis for division by 2, 3, 4, 6 or 12, and the latter for
division by 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 10, 12, 15, 20, 30, or 60. The modern
method is to deal with fractions which have 100 as denominator;
such fractions are called <i>percentages</i>. They only apply accurately
to divisions by 2, 4, 5, 10, 20, 25 or 50; but they have the convenience
of fitting in with the denary scale of notation, and they
can be extended to other divisions by using a mixed number
as numerator. One-fortieth, for instance, can be expressed as
2½/100, which is called 2½ <i>per cent.</i>, and usually written 2½%.
Similarly 3<span class="spp">1</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">3</span>% is equal to one-thirtieth.</p>

<p>If the numerator is a multiple of 5, the fraction represents
twentieths. This is convenient, <i>e.g.</i> for expressing <i>rates in the
pound</i>; thus 15% denotes the process of taking 3s. for every £1,
<i>i.e.</i> a rate of 3s. in the £.</p>

<p>In applications to money &ldquo;per cent.&rdquo; sometimes means &ldquo;per
£100.&rdquo; Thus &ldquo;£3, 17s. 6d. per cent.&rdquo; is really the complex
fraction</p>

<table class="math0" summary="math">
<tr><td rowspan="2">3</td><td>17<span class="spp">6</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">12</span></td></tr>
<tr><td class="denom">20</td></tr>
<tr><td class="denom" colspan="2">100</td></tr></table>

<p>70. <i>Decimal Notation of Percentage.</i>&mdash;An integral percentage,
<i>i.e.</i> a simple fraction with 100 for denominator, can be expressed
by writing the two figures of the numerator (or, if there is only one
figure, this figure preceded by 0) with a dot or &ldquo;point&rdquo; before
them; thus .76 means 76%, or <span class="spp">76</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">100</span>. If there is an integral
number to be taken as well as a percentage, this number is
written in front of the point; thus 23.76 × A means 23 times A,
with 76% of A. We might therefore denote 76% by 0.76.</p>

<p>If as our unit we take X = <span class="spp">1</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">100</span> of A = 1% of A, the above
quantity might equally be written 2376 X = <span class="spp">2376</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">100</span> of A; <i>i.e.</i>
23.76 × A is equal to 2376% of A.</p>

<p>71. <i>Approximate Expression by Percentage.</i>&mdash;When a fraction
cannot be expressed by an integral percentage, it can be so
expressed approximately, by taking the <i>nearest</i> integer to the
numerator of an equal fraction having 100 for its denominator.
Thus <span class="spp">1</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">7</span> = 14<span class="spp">2</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">7</span> / 100, so that <span class="spp">1</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">7</span> is approximately equal to 14%; and
<span class="spp">2</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">7</span> = (28<span class="spp">4</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">7</span>)/100, which is approximately equal to 29%. The difference
between this approximate percentage and the true value is less
than ½%, <i>i.e.</i> is less than <span class="spp">1</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">200</span>.</p>

<p>If the numerator of the fraction consists of an integer and
½&mdash;<i>e.g.</i> in the case of <span class="spp">3</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">8</span> = (37½)/100&mdash;it is uncertain whether we should
take the next lowest or the next highest integer. It is best in
such cases to retain the ½; thus we can write <span class="spp">3</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">8</span> = 37½% =
.37½.</p>

<p>72. <i>Addition and Subtraction of Percentages.</i>&mdash;The sum or
difference of two percentages is expressed by the sum or difference
of the numbers expressing the two percentages.</p>

<p>73. <i>Percentage of a Percentage.</i>&mdash;Since 37% of 1 is expressed by
0.37, 37% of 1% (<i>i.e.</i> of 0.01) might similarly be expressed by
0.00.37. The second point, however, is omitted, so that we write
it 0.0037 or .0037, this expression meaning <span class="spp">37</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">100</span> of <span class="spp">1</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">100</span> = <span class="spp">37</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">10000</span>.</p>

<p>On the same principle, since 37% of 45% is equal to <span class="spp">37</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">100</span> of <span class="spp">45</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">100</span>
= <span class="spp">1665</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">10000</span> = <span class="spp">16</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">100</span> + (<span class="spp">65</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">100</span> of <span class="spp">1</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">100</span>), we can express it by .1665; and
3% of 2% can be expressed by .0006. Hence, to find a percentage
of a percentage, we multiply the two numbers, put 0&rsquo;s in front
if necessary to make up four figures (not counting fractions),
and prefix the point.</p>

<p>74. <i>Decimal Fractions.</i>&mdash;The percentage-notation can be
extended to any fraction which has any power of 10 for its
denominator. Thus <span class="spp">153</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">1000</span> can be written .153 and <span class="spp">15300</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">100000</span> can
be written .15300. These two fractions are equal to each other,
and also to .1530. A fraction written in this way is called a
<i>decimal fraction</i>; or we might define a decimal fraction as a
fraction having a power of 10 for its denominator, there being a
special notation for writing such fractions.</p>

<p>A mixed number, the fractional part of which is a decimal
fraction, is expressed by writing the integral part in front of
the point, which is called the <i>decimal point</i>. Thus 27<span class="spp">1530</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">10000</span>}
can be written 27.1530. This number, expressed in terms of the
fraction <span class="spp">1</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">10000</span> or .0001, would be 271530. Hence the successive
figures after the decimal point have the same relation to each
other and to the figures before the point as if the point did not
exist. The point merely indicates the <i>denomination</i> in which
the number is expressed: the above number, expressed in terms
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page535" id="page535"></a>535</span>
of <span class="spp">1</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">10</span>, would be 271.530, but expressed in terms of 100 it would be
.271530.</p>

<p>Fractions other than decimal fractions are usually called
<i>vulgar fractions</i>.</p>

<p>75. <i>Decimal Numbers.</i>&mdash;Instead of regarding the .153 in
27.153 as meaning <span class="spp">153</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">1000</span>, we may regard the different figures in
the expression as denoting numbers in the successive orders
of submultiples of 1 on a denary scale. Thus, on the grouping
system, 27.153 will mean 2·10 + 7 + 1/10 + 5/10<span class="sp">2</span> + 3/10<span class="sp">3</span>, while on
the counting system it will mean the result of counting
through the tens to 2, then through the ones to 7, then through
tenths to 1, and so on. A number made up in this way may be
called a <i>decimal number</i>, or, more briefly, a <i>decimal</i>.
It will be seen that the definition includes integral numbers.</p>

<p>76. <i>Sums and Differences of Decimals.</i>&mdash;To add or subtract
decimals, we must reduce them to the same denomination, <i>i.e.</i>
if one has more figures after the decimal point than the other,
we must add sufficient 0&rsquo;s to the latter to make the numbers
of figures equal. Thus, to add 5.413 to 3.8, we must write the
latter as 3.800. Or we may treat the former as the sum of
5.4 and .013, and recombine the .013 with the sum of 3.8 and
5.4.</p>

<p>77. <i>Product of Decimals.</i>&mdash;To multiply two decimals exactly,
we multiply them as if the point were absent, and then insert it
so that the number of figures after the point in the product shall
be equal to the sum of the numbers of figures after the points in
the original decimals.</p>

<p>In actual practice, however, decimals only represent approximations,
and the process has to be modified (§ 111).</p>

<p>78. <i>Division by Decimal.</i>&mdash;To divide one decimal by another,
we must reduce them to the same denomination, as explained
in § 76, and then omit the decimal points. Thus 5.413 ÷ 3.8 =
<span class="spp">5413</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">1000</span> ÷ <span class="spp">3800</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">1000</span> = 5413 ÷ 3800.</p>

<p>79. <i>Historical Development of Fractions and Decimals.</i>&mdash;The
fractions used in ancient times were mainly of two kinds:
unit-fractions, <i>i.e.</i> fractions representing aliquot parts (§ 103), and
fractions with a definite denominator.</p>

<p>The Egyptians as a rule used only unit-fractions, other
fractions being expressed as the sum of unit-fractions. The only
known exception was the use of <span class="spp">2</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">3</span> as a single fraction. Except in
the case of <span class="spp">2</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">3</span> and ½, the fraction was expressed by the
denominator, with a special symbol above it.</p>

<p>The Babylonians expressed numbers less than 1 by the numerator
of a fraction with denominator 60; the numerator only being
written. The choice of 60 appears to have been connected with
the reckoning of the year as 360 days; it is perpetuated in the
present subdivision of angles.</p>

<p>The Greeks originally used unit-fractions, like the Egyptians;
later they introduced the sexagesimal fractions of the
Babylonians, extending the system to four or more successive
subdivisions of the unit representing a degree. They also, but
apparently still later and only occasionally, used fractions of the
modern kind. In the sexagesimal system the numerators of the
successive fractions (the denominators of which were the successive
powers of 60) were followed by &prime;, &Prime;, &Prime;&prime;, &Prime;&Prime;, the denominator
not being written. This notation survives in reference to the
minute (&prime;) and second (&Prime;) of angular measurement, and has been
extended, by analogy, to the foot (&prime;) and inch (&Prime;). Since &xi;
represented 60, and &omicron; was the next letter, the latter appears to have
been used to denote absence of one of the fractions; but it is not
clear that our present sign for zero was actually derived from
this. In the case of fractions of the more general kind, the
numerator was written first with &prime;, and then the denominator,
followed by &Prime;, was written twice. A different method was used
by Diophantus, accents being omitted, and the denominator
being written above and to the right of the numerator.</p>

<p>The Romans commonly used fractions with denominator 12;
these were described as <i>unciae</i> (ounces), being twelfths of the
<i>as</i> (pound).</p>

<p>The modern system of placing the numerator above the
denominator is due to the Hindus; but the dividing line is a
later invention. Various systems were tried before the present
notation came to be generally accepted. Under one system, for
instance, the continued sum 4/5 + 1/(7 × 5) + 3/(8 × 7 × 5) would be denoted
by (3 1 4)/(8 7 5); this is somewhat similar in principle to a decimal
notation, but with digits taken in the reverse order.</p>

<p>Hindu treatises on arithmetic show the use of fractions,
containing a power of 10 as denominator, as early as the beginning
of the 6th century <span class="scs">A.D.</span> There was, however, no development
in the direction of decimals in the modern sense, and the
Arabs, by whom the Hindu notation of integers was brought to
Europe, mainly used the sexagesimal division in the &prime; &Prime; &Prime;&prime;
notation. Even where the decimal notation would seem to arise
naturally, as in the case of approximate extraction of a square
root, the portion which might have been expressed as a decimal
was converted into sexagesimal fractions. It was not until
<span class="scs">A.D.</span> 1585 that a decimal notation was published by Simon
Stevinus of Bruges. It is worthy of notice that the invention of
this notation appears to have been due to practical needs, being
required for the purpose of computation of compound interest.
The present decimal notation, which is a development of that of
Stevinus, was first used in 1617 by H. Briggs, the computer of
logarithms.</p>

<p>80. <i>Fractions of Concrete Quantities.</i>&mdash;The British systems
of coinage, weights, lengths, &amp;c., afford many examples of the
use of fractions. These may be divided into three classes, as
follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>(i) The fraction of a concrete quantity may itself not exist as
a concrete quantity, but be represented by a token. Thus, if we
take a shilling as a unit, we may divide it into 12 or 48 smaller
units; but corresponding coins are not really portions of a
shilling, but objects which help us in counting. Similarly we
may take the farthing as a unit, and invent smaller units,
represented either by tokens or by no material objects at all.
Ten marks, for instance, might be taken as equivalent to a
farthing; but 13 marks are not equivalent to anything except
one farthing and three out of the ten acts of counting required
to arrive at another farthing.</p>

<p>(ii) In the second class of cases the fraction of the unit quantity
is a quantity of the same kind, but cannot be determined with
absolute exactness. Weights come in this class. The ounce,
for instance, is one-sixteenth of the pound, but it is impossible to
find 16 objects such that their weights shall be exactly equal and
that the sum of their weights shall be exactly equal to the weight
of the standard pound.</p>

<p>(iii) Finally, there are the cases of linear measurement, where
it is theoretically possible to find, by geometrical methods, an
exact submultiple of a given unit, but both the unit and the
submultiple are not really concrete objects, but are spatial
relations embodied in objects.</p>

<p>Of these three classes, the first is the least abstract and the
last the most abstract. The first only involves number and
counting. The second involves the idea of <i>equality</i> as a necessary
characteristic of the units or subunits that are used. The third
involves also the idea of <i>continuity</i> and therefore of unlimited
subdivision. In weighing an object with ounce-weights the fact
that it weighs more than 1 &#8468; 3 oz. but less than 1 &#8468; 4 oz. does
not of itself suggest the necessity or possibility of subdivision
of the ounce for purposes of greater accuracy. But in measuring
a distance we may find that it is &ldquo;between&rdquo; two distances
differing by a unit of the lowest denomination used, and a
subdivision of this unit follows naturally.</p>

<p class="pt2 center sc">VII. Approximation</p>

<p>81. <i>Approximate Character of Numbers.</i>&mdash;The numbers
(integral or decimal) by which we represent the results of arithmetical
operations are often only approximately correct. All
numbers, for instance, which represent physical measurements, are
limited in their accuracy not only by our powers of measurement
but also by the accuracy of the measure we use as our unit. Also
most fractions cannot be expressed exactly as decimals; and this
is also the case for surds and logarithms, as well as for the numbers
expressing certain ratios which arise out of geometrical relations.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page536" id="page536"></a>536</span>
Even where numbers are supposed to be exact, calculations
based on them can often only be approximate. We might, for
instance, calculate the exact cost of 3 &#8468; 5 oz. of meat at 9½ d.
a &#8468;, but there are no coins in which we could pay this exact
amount.</p>

<p>When the result of any arithmetical operation or operations
is represented approximately but not exactly by a number,
the excess (positive or negative) of this number over the
number which would express the result exactly is called the
<i>error</i>.</p>

<p>82. <i>Degree of Accuracy.</i>&mdash;There are three principal ways of
expressing the degree of accuracy of any number, <i>i.e.</i> the extent
to which it is equal to the number it is intended to represent.</p>

<p>(i) A number can be <i>correct to</i> so many <i>places of decimals</i>.
This means (cf. § 71) that the number differs from the true value
by less than one-half of the unit represented by 1 in the last place
of decimals. For instance, .143 represents <span class="spp">1</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">7</span> correct to 3 places of
decimals, since it differs from it by less than .0005. The final
figure, in a case like this, is said to be <i>corrected</i>.</p>

<p>This method is not good for comparative purposes. Thus .143
and 14.286 represent respectively <span class="spp">1</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">7</span> and <span class="spp">100</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">7</span> to the same number
of places of decimals, but the latter is obviously more exact than
the former.</p>

<p>(ii) A number can be correct to so many <i>significant figures</i>.
The significant figures of a number are those which commence
with the first figure other than zero in the number; thus the
significant figures of 13.027 and of .00013027 are the same.</p>

<p>This is the usual method; but the relative accuracy of two
numbers expressed to the same number of significant figures
depends to a certain extent on the magnitude of the first figure.
Thus .14286 and .85714 represent <span class="spp">1</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">7</span> and <span class="spp">6</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">7</span> correct to 5 significant
figures; but the latter is relatively more accurate than the former.
For the former shows only that <span class="spp">1</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">7</span> lies between .142855 and
.142865, or, as it is better expressed, between .14285½ and
.14286½; but the latter shows that <span class="spp">6</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">7</span> lies between .85713½
and .85714½, and therefore that <span class="spp">1</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">7</span> lies between .14285<span class="spp">7</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">12</span> and
.14285<span class="spp">9</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">12</span>.</p>

<p>In either of the above cases, and generally in any case where a
number is known to be within a certain limit on each side of
the stated value, the <i>limit of error</i> is expressed by the sign ±.
Thus the former of the above two statements would give <span class="spp">1</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">7</span> =
.14286 ± .000005. It should be observed that the numerical
value of the error is to be subtracted from or added to the
stated value according as the error is positive or negative.</p>

<p>(iii) The limit of error can be expressed as a fraction of
the number as stated. Thus <span class="spp">1</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">7</span> = .143 ± .0005 can be written
<span class="spp">1</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">7</span> = 143(1 ± <span class="spp">1</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">286</span>).</p>

<p>83. <i>Accuracy after Arithmetical Operations.</i>&mdash;If the numbers
which are the subject of operations are not all exact, the accuracy
of the result requires special investigation in each case.</p>

<p>Additions and subtractions are simple. If, for instance, the
values of a and b, correct to two places of decimals, are 3.58 and
1.34, then 2.24, as the value of a &minus; b, is not necessarily correct
to two places. The limit of error of each being ±.005, the limit
of error of their sum or difference is ±.01.</p>

<p>For multiplication we make use of the formula (§ 60 (i))
(a&prime; ± &alpha;)(b&prime; ± &beta;) = a&prime;b&prime; + a&beta; ± (a&prime;&beta; + b&prime;&alpha;).
If a&prime; and b&prime; are the stated values,
and ±&alpha; and ±&beta; the respective limits of error, we ought strictly
to take a&prime;b&prime; + &alpha;&beta; as the product, with a limit of error ±(a&prime;&beta; + b&prime;&alpha;).
In practice, however, both &alpha;&beta; and a certain portion of a&prime;b&prime; are
small in comparison with a&prime;&beta; and b&prime;&alpha;, and we therefore replace
a&prime;b&prime; + &alpha;&beta; by an approximate value, and increase the limit of
error so as to cover the further error thus introduced. In the case
of the two numbers given in the last paragraph, the product lies
between 3.575 × 1.335 = 4.772625 and 3.585 × 1.345 = 4.821825.
We might take the product as (3.58 × 1.34) + (.005)<span class="sp">2</span> = 4.797225,
the limits of error being ±.005(3.58 + 1.34) = ±.0246; but it is
more convenient to write it in such a form as 4.797 ± .025 or
4.80 ± .03.</p>

<p>If the number of decimal places to which a result is to be
accurate is determined beforehand, it is usually not necessary
in the actual working to go to more than two or three places
beyond this. At the close of the work the extra figures are
dropped, the last figure which remains being corrected (§ 82 (i))
if necessary.</p>

<p class="pt2 center sc">VIII. Surds and Logarithms</p>

<p>84. <i>Roots and Surds.</i>&mdash;The pth root of a number (§ 43) may,
if the number is an integer, be found by expressing it in terms of
its prime factors; or, if it is not an integer, by expressing it as
a fraction in its lowest terms, and finding the pth roots of the
numerator and of the denominator separately. Thus to find the
cube root of 1728, we write it in the form 2<span class="sp">6</span>}·3<span class="sp">3</span>, and find that
its cube root is 2<span class="sp">2</span>·3 = 12; or, to find the cube root of 1.728, we
write it as <span class="spp">1728</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">1000</span> = <span class="spp">216</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">125</span> = 2<span class="sp">3</span>·3<span class="sp">3</span>/5<span class="sp">3</span>, and find that the cube root is
2·3/5 = 1.2. Similarly the cube root of 2197 is 13. But we cannot
find any number whose cube is 2000.</p>

<p>It is, however, possible to find a number whose cube shall
approximate as closely as we please to 2000. Thus the cubes of
12.5 and of 12.6 are respectively 1953.125 and 2000.376, so that
the number whose cube differs as little as possible from 2000 is
somewhere between 12.5 and 12.6. Again the cube of 12.59 is
1995.616979, so that the number lies between 12.59 and 12.60.
We may therefore consider that there is some number x whose
cube is 2000, and we can find this number to any degree of
accuracy that we please.</p>

<p>A number of this kind is called a <i>surd</i>; the surd which is the
pth root of N is written <span class="sp">p</span>&radic;N, but if the index is 2 it is usually
omitted, so that the square root of N is written &radic;N.</p>

<p>85. <i>Surd as a Power.</i>&mdash;We have seen (§§ 43, 44) that, if we take
the successive powers of a number N, commencing with 1, they
may be written N<span class="sp">0</span>, N<span class="sp">1</span>, N<span class="sp">2</span>, N<span class="sp">3</span>, ..., the series of indices being
the standard series; and we have also seen (§ 44) that multiplication
of any two of these numbers corresponds to addition of
their indices. Hence we may insert in the power-series numbers
with fractional indices, provided that the multiplication of these
numbers follows the same law. The number denoted by N<span class="sp">1/3</span> will
therefore be such that N<span class="sp">1/3</span> × N<span class="sp">1/3</span> × N<span class="sp">1/3</span> = N<span class="sp">1/3 + 1/3 + 1/3</span> = N; <i>i.e.</i> it will
be the cube root of N. By analogy with the notation of fractional
numbers, N<span class="sp">2/3</span> will be N<span class="sp">1/3 + 1/3</span> = N<span class="sp">1/3</span> × N<span class="sp">1/3</span>; and, generally, N<span class="sp">p/q</span> will
mean the product of p numbers, the product of q of which is equal
to N. Thus N<span class="sp">2/6</span> will not mean the <i>same</i> as N<span class="sp">1/3</span>, but will mean the
square of N<span class="sp">1/6</span>; but this will be <i>equal</i> to N<span class="sp">1/3</span>, <i>i.e.</i>
(<span class="sp">6</span>&radic;N)<span class="sp">2</span> = <span class="sp">3</span>&radic;N.</p>

<p>86. <i>Multiplication and Division of Surds.</i>&mdash;To add or subtract
fractional numbers, we must reduce them to a common denominator;
and similarly, to multiply or divide surds, we must express
them as power-numbers with the same index. Thus <span class="sp">3</span>&radic;2 × &radic;5 =
2<span class="sp">1/3</span> × 5<span class="sp">1/2</span> = 2<span class="sp">2/6</span> × 5<span class="sp">3/6</span> = 4<span class="sp">1/6</span> × 125<span class="sp">1/6</span> = 500<span class="sp">1/6</span> = <span class="sp">6</span>&radic;500.</p>

<p>87. <i>Antilogarithms.</i>&mdash;If we take a fixed number, <i>e.g.</i> 2, as base,
and take as indices the successive decimal numbers to any particular
number of places of decimals, we get a series of <i>antilogarithms</i>
of the indices to this base. Thus, if we go to two places of
decimals, we have as the integral series the numbers 1, 2, 4, 8, ... which
are the values of 2<span class="sp">0</span>, 2<span class="sp">1</span>, 2<span class="sp">2</span>, ... and we insert within
this series the successive powers of x, where x is such that x<span class="sp">100</span> = 2.
We thus get the numbers 2<span class="sp">.01</span>, 2<span class="sp">.02</span>, 2<span class="sp">.03</span>, ..., which are the
antilogarithms of .01, .02, .03, ... to base 2; the first antilogarithm
being 2<span class="sp">.00</span> = 1, which is thus the antilogarithm of 0 to this (or any
other) base. The series is formed by successive multiplication,
and any antilogarithm to a larger number of decimal places is
formed from it in the same way by multiplication. If, for
instance, we have found 2<span class="sp">.31</span>, then the value of 2<span class="sp">.316</span> is
found from it by multiplying by the 6th power of the 1000th
root of 2.</p>

<p>For practical purposes the number taken as base is 10; the
convenience of this being that the increase of the index by an
integer means multiplication by the corresponding power of 10,
<i>i.e.</i> it means a shifting of the decimal point. In the same way,
by dividing by powers of 10 we may get negative indices.</p>

<p>88. <i>Logarithms.</i>&mdash;If N is the antilogarithm of p to the base a,
<i>i.e.</i> if N = a<span class="sp">p</span>, then p is called the logarithm of N to the base a,
and is written log<span class="su">a</span> N. As the table of antilogarithms is formed
by successive multiplications, so the logarithm of any given
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page537" id="page537"></a>537</span>
number is in theory found by successive divisions. Thus, to find
the logarithm of a number to base 2, the number being greater
than 1, we first divide repeatedly by 2 until we get a number
between 1 and 2; then divide repeatedly by <span class="sp">10</span>&radic;2 until we get
a number between 1 and <span class="sp">10</span>&radic;2; then divide repeatedly by <span class="sp">100</span>&radic;2;
and so on. If, for instance, we find that the number is approximately
equal to 2<span class="sp">3</span> × (<span class="sp">10</span>&radic;2)<span class="sp">5</span> × (<span class="sp">100</span>&radic;2)<span class="sp">7</span> × (<span class="sp">1000</span>&radic;2)<span class="sp">4</span>, it may be
written 2<span class="sp">3.574</span>, and its logarithm to base 2 is 3.574.</p>

<p>For a further explanation of logarithms, and for an explanation
of the treatment of cases in which an antilogarithm is less than
1, see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Logarithm</a></span>.</p>

<p>For practical purposes logarithms are usually calculated to
base 10, so that log<span class="su">10</span> 10 = 1, log<span class="su">10</span> 100 = 2, &amp;c.</p>

<p class="pt2 center sc">IX. Units</p>

<p>89. <i>Change of Denomination</i> of a numerical quantity is usually
called <i>reduction</i>, so that this term covers, <i>e.g.</i>, the expression of
£153, 7s. 4d. as shillings and pence and also the expression of
3067s. 4d. as £, s. and d.</p>

<table class="nobctr" style="float: right; width: 300px;" summary="Illustration">
<tr><td class="figright1"><img style="width:296px; height:328px" src="images/img537a.jpg" alt="" /></td></tr></table>

<p>The usual statement is that to express £153, 7s. as shillings we
multiply 153 by 20 and add 7. This, as already explained (§ 37),
is incorrect. £153 denotes 153 units, each of which is £1 or 20s.;
and therefore we must multiply 20s. by 153 and add 7s., <i>i.e.</i>
multiply 20 by 153 (the unit being now 1s.) and add 7. This is
the expression of the process on the grouping method. On the
counting method we have
a scale with every 20th
shilling marked as a £;
there are 153 of these 20&rsquo;s,
and 7 over.</p>

<p>The simplest case, in
which the quantity can be
expressed as an integral
number of the largest units
involved, has already been
considered (§§ 37, 42). The
same method can be
applied in other cases
by regarding a quantity
expressed in several denominations
as a fractional
number of units of the
largest denomination mentioned;
thus 7s. 4d. is to be taken as meaning 7<span class="spp">4</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">12</span>s., but
£0, 7s. 4d. as £0[(7<span class="spp">4</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">12</span>) / 20] (§ 17). The reduction of £153, 7s. 4d. to pence,
and of 36808d. to £, s. d., on this principle, is shown in diagrams
A and B above.</p>

<p>For reduction of pounds to shillings, or shillings to pounds, we
must consider that we have a multiple-table (§ 36) in which the
multiples of £1 and of 20s. are arranged in parallel columns;
and similarly for shillings and pence.</p>

<p>90. <i>Change of Unit.</i>&mdash;The statement &ldquo;£153 = 3060s.&rdquo; is not
a statement of <i>equality</i> of the same kind as the statement
&ldquo;153 × 20 = 3060,&rdquo; but only a statement of <i>equivalence</i> for
certain purposes; in other words, it does not convey an
absolute truth. It is therefore of interest to see whether we
cannot replace it by an absolute truth.</p>

<p>To do this, consider what the ordinary processes of multiplication
and division mean in reference to concrete objects. If
we want to give, to 5 boys, 4 apples each, we are said to multiply
4 apples by 5. We cannot multiply 4 apples by 5 boys, for then
we should get 20 &ldquo;boy-apples,&rdquo; an expression which has no
meaning. Or, again, to distribute 20 apples amongst 5 boys,
we are not regarded as dividing 20 apples by 5 boys, but as dividing
20 apples by the number 5. The multiplication or division
here involves the omission of the unit &ldquo;boy,&rdquo; and the operation
is incomplete. The complete operation, in each case, is as
follows.</p>

<p>(i) In the case of multiplication we commence with the
conception of the number &ldquo;5&rdquo; and the unit &ldquo;boy&rdquo;; and we
then convert this unit into 4 apples, and thus obtain the result,
20 apples. The conversion of the unit may be represented as
multiplication by a factor (4 apples)/(1 boy), so that the operation is
(4 apples)/(1 boy) × (5 boys) = 5 × (4 apples)/(1 boy) × (1 boy) = 5 × 4 apples = 20 apples.
Similarly, to convert £153 into shillings we must multiply it by a
factor 20s./£1, so that we get</p>

<table class="math0" summary="math">
<tr><td>20s.</td> <td rowspan="2">× £153 = 153 ×</td> <td>20s.</td>
  <td rowspan="2">× £1 = 153 × 20s. = 3060s.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="denom">£1</td> <td class="denom">£1</td></tr></table>

<p class="noind">Hence we can only regard £153 as being equal to 3060s. if we
regard this converting factor as unity.</p>

<p>(ii) In the case of partition we can express the complete operation
if we extend the meaning of division so as to enable us to
divide 20 apples by 5 boys. We thus get (20 apples)/(5 boys) = (4 apples)/(1 boy),
which means that the distribution can be effected by distributing
at the rate of 4 apples per boy. The converting factor mentioned
under (i) therefore represents a <i>rate</i>; and partition, applied to
concrete cases, leads to a rate.</p>

<p>In reference to the use of the sign × with the converting factor,
it should be observed that &ldquo;(7 &#8468;)/(4 &#8468;) ×&rdquo; symbolizes the replacing of
so many times 4 &#8468; by the same number of times 7 &#8468;, while
&ldquo;<span class="spp">7</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">4</span> ×&rdquo; symbolizes the replacing of 4 times something by 7 times
that something.</p>

<p class="pt2 center sc">X. Arithmetical Reasoning</p>

<p>91. <i>Correspondence of Series of Numbers.</i>&mdash;In §§ 33-42 we have
dealt with the parallelism of the original number-series with a
series consisting of the corresponding multiples of some unit,
whether a number or a numerical quantity; and the relations
arising out of multiplication, division, &amp;c., have been exhibited by
diagrams comprising pairs of corresponding terms of the two series.
This, however, is only a particular case of the correspondence
of two series. In considering addition, for instance, we have
introduced two parallel series, each being the original number-series,
but the two being placed in different positions. If we add
1, 2, 3, ... to 6, we obtain a series 7, 8, 9, ..., the terms of
which correspond with those of the original series 1, 2, 3,...</p>

<p>Again, in §§ 61-75 and 84-88 we have considered various kinds
of numbers other than those in the original number-series.
In general, these have involved two of the original numbers, <i>e.g.</i>
5<span class="sp">3</span> involves 5 and 3, and log<span class="su">2</span> 8 involves 2 and 8. In some cases,
however, <i>e.g.</i> in the case of negative numbers and reciprocals,
only one is involved; and there might be three or more, as in the
case of a number expressed by (a + b)<span class="sp">n</span>. If all but one of these
constituent elements are settled beforehand, <i>e.g.</i> if we take the
numbers 5, 5<span class="sp">2</span>, 5<span class="sp">3</span>, ..., or the numbers <span class="sp">3</span>&radic;1, <span class="sp">3</span>&radic;2, <span class="sp">3</span>&radic;3, ... or
log<span class="su">10</span> 1.001, log<span class="su">10</span> 1.002, log<span class="su">10</span> 1.003 ... we obtain a series in which each
term corresponds with a term of the original number-series.</p>

<table class="nobctr" style="float: right; width: 350px;" summary="Illustration">
<tr><td class="figright1"><img style="width:296px; height:239px" src="images/img537b.jpg" alt="" /></td></tr>
<tr><td class="caption1"></td></tr></table>

<p>This correspondence is usually shown by <i>tabulation, i.e</i>. by the
formation of a table in which the original series is shown in one
column, and each term of
the second series is placed
in a second column opposite
the corresponding
term of the first series,
each column being headed
by a description of its
contents. It is sometimes
convenient to begin the
first series with 0, and even
to give the series of negative
numbers; in most
cases, however, these latter
are regarded as belonging to a different series, and they need not
be considered here. The diagrams, A, B, C are simple forms of
tables; A giving a sum-series, B a multiple-series, and C a
series of square roots, calculated approximately.</p>

<p>92. <i>Correspondence of Numerical Quantities.</i>&mdash;Again, in § 89, we
have considered cases of multiple-tables of numerical quantities,
where each quantity in one series is <i>equivalent</i> to the corresponding
quantity in the other series. We might extend this principle
to cases in which the terms of two series, whether of numbers or
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page538" id="page538"></a>538</span>
of numerical quantities, merely <i>correspond</i> with each other, the
correspondence being the result of some relation. The volume
of a cube, for instance, bears a certain
relation to the length of an edge of the
cube. This relation is not one of proportion;
but it may nevertheless be
expressed by tabulation, as shown at D.</p>

<p class="nom">&nbsp;</p>

<table class="nobctr" style="float: right; width: 250px;" summary="Illustration">
<tr><td class="figright1"><img style="width:197px; height:260px" src="images/img538.jpg" alt="" /></td></tr>
<tr><td class="caption1"></td></tr></table>

<p>93. <i>Interpolation.</i>&mdash;In most cases the
quantity in the second column may
be regarded as increasing or decreasing
continuously as the number in the first
column increases, and it has intermediate
values corresponding to intermediate
(<i>i.e.</i> fractional or decimal)
numbers not shown in the table. The
table in such cases is not, and cannot
be, complete, even up to the number to which it goes. For
instance, a cube whose edge is 1½ in. has a definite volume,
viz. 3<span class="spp">3</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">8</span> cub. in. The determination of any such intermediate
value is performed by <i>Interpolation</i> (<i>q.v.</i>).</p>

<p>In treating a fractional number, or the corresponding value of
the quantity in the second column, as intermediate, we are in effect
regarding the numbers 1, 2, 3, ..., and the corresponding
numbers in the second column, as denoting points between which
other numbers lie, <i>i.e.</i> we are regarding the numbers as <i>ordinal</i>,
not cardinal. The transition is similar to that which arises in the
case of geometrical measurement (§ 26), and it is an essential
feature of all reasoning with regard to continuous quantity, such
as we have to deal with in real life.</p>

<p>94. <i>Nature of Arithmetical Reasoning.</i>&mdash;The simplest form of
arithmetical reasoning consists in the determination of the term
in one series corresponding to a given term in another series, when
the relation between the two series is given; and it implies,
though it does not necessarily involve, the establishment of each
series as a whole by determination of its unit. A method
involving the determination of the unit is called a <i>unitary</i>
method. When the unit is not determined, the reasoning is
algebraical rather than arithmetical. If, for instance, three
terms of a proportion are given, the fourth can be obtained by
the relation given at the end of § 57, this relation being then
called the <i>Rule of Three</i>; but this is equivalent to the use of an
algebraical formula.</p>

<p>More complicated forms of arithmetical reasoning involve the
use of series, each term in which corresponds to particular terms
in two or more series jointly; and cases of this kind are usually
dealt with by special methods, or by means of algebraical
formulae. The old-fashioned problems about the amount of work
done by particular numbers of men, women and boys, are of this
kind, and really involve the solution of simultaneous equations.
They are not suitable for elementary purposes, as the arithmetical
relations involved are complicated and difficult to grasp.</p>

<p class="pt2 center sc">XI. Methods of Calculation</p>

<p class="pt1 center">(i.) <i>Exact Calculation.</i></p>

<p>95. <i>Working from Left.</i>&mdash;It is desirable, wherever possible, to
perform operations on numbers or numerical quantities from
the left, rather than from the right. There are several reasons
for this. In the first place, an operation then corresponds more
closely, at an elementary stage, with the concrete process which it
represents. If, for instance, we had one sum of £3, 15s. 9d. and
another of £2, 6s. 5d., we should add them by putting the coins
of each denomination together and commencing the addition with
the £. In the second place, this method fixes the attention at
once on the larger, and therefore more important, parts of the
quantities concerned, and thus prevents arithmetical processes
from becoming too abstract in character. In the third place, it is
a better preparation for dealing with approximate calculations.
Finally, experience shows that certain operations in which the
result is written down at once&mdash;<i>e.g.</i> addition or subtraction of
two numbers or quantities, and multiplication by some small
numbers&mdash;are with a little practice performed more quickly and
more accurately from left to right.</p>

<p>96. <i>Addition.</i>&mdash;There is no difference in principle between
addition (or subtraction) of numbers and addition (or subtraction)
of numerical quantities. In each case the grouping system
involves rearrangement, which implies the commutative law,
while the counting system requires the expression of a quantity in
different denominations to be regarded as a notation in a varying
scale (§§ 17, 32). We need therefore consider numerical quantities
only, our results being applicable to numbers by regarding the
digits as representing multiples of units in different denominations.</p>

<p>When the result of addition in one denomination can be partly
expressed in another denomination, the process is technically
called <i>carrying</i>. The name is a bad one, since it does not correspond
with any ordinary meaning of the verb. It would be better
described as <i>exchanging</i>, by analogy with the &ldquo;changing&rdquo; of
subtraction. When, <i>e.g.</i>, we find that the sum of 17s. and 18s. is
35s., we take out 20 of the 35 shillings, and exchange them for £1.</p>

<p>To add from the left, we have to look ahead to see whether
the next addition will require an exchange. Thus, in adding
£3, 17s. 0d. to £2, 18s. 0d., we write down the sum of £3 and £2
as £6, not as £5, and the sum of 17s. and 18s. as 15s., not as 35s.</p>

<p>When three or more numbers or quantities are added together,
the result should always be checked by adding both upwards
and downwards. It is also useful to look out for pairs of numbers
or quantities which make 1 of the next denomination, <i>e.g.</i> 7 and 3,
or 8d. and 4d.</p>

<p>97. <i>Subtraction.</i>&mdash;To subtract £3, 5s. 4d. from £9, 7s. 8d., on
the grouping system, we split up each quantity into its denominations,
perform the subtractions independently, and then regroup
the results as the &ldquo;remainder&rdquo; £6, 2s. 4d. On the counting
system we can count either forwards or backwards, and we can
work either from the left or from the right. If we count forwards
we find that to convert £3, 5s. 4d. into £9, 7s. 8d. we must
successively add £6, 2s. and 4d. if we work from the left, or 4d.,
2s. and £6 if we work from the right. The intermediate values
obtained by the successive additions are different according
as we work from the left or from the right, being £9, 5s. 4d. and
£9, 7s. 4d. in the one case, and £3, 5s. 8d. and £3, 7s. 8d. in the
other. If we count backwards, the intermediate values are
£3, 7s. 8d. and £3, 5s. 8d. in the one case, and £9, 7s. 4d. and
£9, 5s. 4d. in the other.</p>

<p>The determination of each element in the remainder involves
reference to an addition-table. Thus to subtract 5s. from 7s. we
refer to an addition-table giving the sum of any two quantities,
each of which is one of the series 0s., 1s., ... 19s.</p>

<p>Subtraction by counting forward is called <i>complementary
addition</i>.</p>

<p>To subtract £3, 5s. 8d. from £9, 10s. 4d., on the grouping
system, we must <i>change</i> 1s. out of the 10s. into 12d., so that we
subtract £3, 5s. 8d. from £9, 9s. 16d. On the counting system
it will be found that, in determining the number of shillings in
the remainder, we subtract 5s. from 9s. if we count forwards,
working from the left, or backwards, working from the right;
while, if we count backwards, working from the left, or
forwards, working from the right, the subtraction is of 6s.
from 10s. In the first two cases the successive values (in
direct or reverse order) are £3, 5s. 8d., £9, 5s. 8d., £9, 9s. 8d. and
£9, 10s. 4d.; while in the last two cases they are £9, 10s. 4d.,
£3, 10s. 4d., £3, 6s. 4d. and £3, 5s. 8d.</p>

<p>In subtracting from the left, we look ahead to see whether a 1
in any denomination must be reserved for changing; thus in
subtracting 274 from 637 we should put down 2 from 6 as 3, not as
4, and 7 from 3 as 6.</p>

<p>98. <i>Multiplication-Table.</i>&mdash;For multiplication and division we
use a <i>multiplication-table</i>, which is a multiple-table, arranged as
explained in § 36, and giving the successive multiples, up to
9 times or further, of the numbers from 1 (or better, from 0) to 10,
12 or 20. The column (vertical) headed 3 will give the multiples
of 3, while the row (horizontal) commencing with 3 will give the
values of 3 × 1, 3 × 2, ... To multiply by 3 we use the row.
To divide by 3, in the sense of partition, we also use the row;
but to divide by 3 as a unit we use the column.</p>

<p>99. <i>Multiplication by a Small Number.</i>&mdash;The idea of a large
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page539" id="page539"></a>539</span>
multiple of a small number is simpler than that of a small multiple
of a large number, but the calculation of the latter is easier. It
is therefore convenient, in finding the product of two numbers,
to take the smaller as the multiplier.</p>

<p>To find 3 times 427, we apply the distributive law (§ 58 (vi))
that 3·427 = 3(400 + 20 + 7) = 3·400 + 3·20 + 3·7. This, if we regard
3·427 as 427 + 427 + 427, is a direct consequence of the commutative
law for addition (§ 58 (iii)), which enables us to add
separately the hundreds, the tens and the ones. To find 3·400,
we treat 100 as the unit (as in addition), so that 3·400 = 3·4·100 =
12·100 = 1200; and similarly for 3·20. These are examples of the
associative law for multiplication (§ 58 (iv)).</p>

<p>100. <i>Special Cases.</i>&mdash;The following are some special rules:&mdash;</p>

<p>(i) To multiply by 5, multiply by 10 and divide by 2. (And
conversely, to divide by 5, we multiply by 2 and divide by 10.)</p>

<p>(ii) In multiplying by 2, from the left, add 1 if the next figure of
the multiplicand is 5, 6, 7, 8 or 9.</p>

<p>(iii) In multiplying by 3, from the left, add 1 when the next
figures are not less than 33 ... 334 and not greater than 66 ... 666,
and 2 when they are 66 ... 667 and upwards.</p>

<p>(iv) To multiply by 7, 8, 9, 11 or 12, treat the multiplier as
10 &minus; 3, 10 &minus; 2, 10 &minus; 1, 10 + 1 or 10 + 2; and similarly for 13, 17, 18, 19, &amp;c.</p>

<p>(v) To multiply by 4 or 6, we can either multiply from the left
by 2 and then by 2 or 3, or multiply from the right by 4 or 6;
or we can treat the multiplier as 5 &minus; 1 or 5 + 1.</p>

<p>101. <i>Multiplication by a Large Number.</i>&mdash;When both the
numbers are large, we split up one of them, preferably the
multiplier, into separate portions. Thus
231·4273 = (200 + 30 + 1)·4273 = 200·4273 + 30·4273 + 1·4273.
This gives the <i>partial products</i>,
the sum of which is the complete products. The process is shown
fully in A below,&mdash;</p>

<div class="center ptb1"><img style="width:484px; height:156px" src="images/img539a.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p class="noind">and more concisely in B. To multiply 4273 by 200, we use
the commutative law, which gives 200·4273 = 2 × 100 × 4273 =
2 × 4273 × 100 = 8546 × 100 = 854600; and similarly for 30·4273.
In B the terminal 0&rsquo;s of the partial products are omitted. It is
usually convenient to make out a preliminary table of multiples
up to 10 times; the table being checked at 5 times (§ 100) and at
10 times.</p>

<p>The main difficulty is in the correct placing of the curtailed
partial products. The first step is to regard the product of two
numbers as containing as many digits as the two numbers put
together. The table of multiples will them be as in C. The next
step is to arrange the multiplier and the multiplicand above the
partial products. For elementary work the multiplicand may
come immediately after the multiplier, as in D; the last figure
of each partial product then comes immediately under the corresponding
figure of the multiplier. A better method, which leads
up to the multiplication of decimals and of approximate values
of numbers, is to place the first figure of the multipler under
the first figure of the multiplicand, as in E; the first figure of
each partial product will then come under the corresponding
figure of the multiplier.</p>

<div class="center ptb1"><img style="width:377px; height:173px" src="images/img539b.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<table class="nobctr" style="float: right; width: 225px;" summary="Illustration">
<tr><td class="figright1"><img style="width:173px; height:112px" src="images/img539c.jpg" alt="" /></td></tr></table>

<p>102. <i>Contracted Multiplication.</i>&mdash;The partial products are
sometimes omitted; the process saves time in writing, but is not
easy. The principle is that, <i>e.g.</i> (a·10<span class="sp">2</span> + b·10 + c)(p·10<span class="sp">2</span> + q<span class="sp">10</span> + r)
= ap·10<span class="sp">4</span> + (aq + bp)·10<span class="sp">3</span> + (ar + bq + cp)·10<span class="sp">2</span> + (br + cq)·10 + cr.
Hence the digits are multiplied in pairs, and grouped according
to the power of 10 which each product contains. A method of
performing the process is shown here for the case of 162·427.
The principle is that 162·427 = 100·427 + 60·427 + 2·427 =
1·42700 + 6·4270 + 2·427; but, instead of
writing down the separate products, we
(in effect) write 42700, 4270, and 427 in
separate rows, with the multipliers 1, 6, 2
in the margin, and then multiply each
number in each column by the corresponding
multiplier in the margin, making allowance for any
figures to be &ldquo;carried.&rdquo; Thus the second figure (from the
right) is given by 1 + 2·2 + 6·7 = 47, the 1 being carried.</p>

<p>103. <i>Aliquot Parts.</i>&mdash;For multiplication by a proper fraction
or a decimal, it is sometimes convenient, especially when we are
dealing with mixed quantities, to convert the multiplier into the
sum or difference of a number of fractions, each of which has 1 as
its numerator. Such fractions are called <i>aliquot parts</i> (from Lat.
<i>aliquot</i>, some, several). This can usually be done in a good many
ways. Thus <span class="spp">5</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">6</span> = 1 &minus; <span class="spp">1</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">6</span>, and also = ½ + <span class="spp">1</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">3</span>; and 15% = .15 = <span class="spp">1</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">10</span> + <span class="spp">1</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">20</span> =
<span class="spp">1</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">6</span> &minus; <span class="spp">1</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">60</span> = <span class="spp">1</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">8</span> + <span class="spp">1</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">40</span>. The fractions should generally be chosen so
that each part of the product may be obtained from an earlier
part by a comparatively simple division. Thus ½ + <span class="spp">1</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">20</span> &minus; <span class="spp">1</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">60</span> is a
simpler expression for <span class="spp">8</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">15</span> than ½ + <span class="spp">1</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">30</span>.</p>

<p>The process may sometimes by applied two or three times in
succession; thus <span class="spp">8</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">15</span> = <span class="spp">4</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">5</span>·<span class="spp">2</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">3</span> = (1 &minus; <span class="spp">1</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">5</span>)(1 &minus; <span class="spp">1</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">3</span>), and
<span class="spp">33</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">40</span> = ¾·<span class="spp">11</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">10</span> = (1 &minus; ¼)(1 + <span class="spp">1</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">10</span>).</p>

<p>104. <i>Practice.</i>&mdash;The above is a particular case of the method
called <i>practice</i>, but the nomenclature of the method is confusing.
There are two kinds of practice, <i>simple practice</i> and <i>compound
practice</i>, but the latter is the simpler of the two. To find the cost
of 2 &#8468; 8 oz. of butter at 1s. 2d. a &#8468;, we multiply 1s. 2d. by
2<span class="spp">8</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">16</span> = 2½. This straightforward process is called &ldquo;compound&rdquo;
practice. &ldquo;Simple&rdquo; practice involves an application of the
commutative law. To find the cost of n articles at £a, bs, cd.
each, we express £a, bs, cd. in the form £(a + f), where f is a
fraction (or the sum of several fractions); we then say that the
cost, being n × £(a + f), is equal to (a + f) × £n, and apply the
method of compound practice, <i>i.e.</i> the method of aliquot parts.</p>

<p>105. <i>Multiplication of a Mixed Number.</i>&mdash;When a mixed
quantity or a mixed number has to be multiplied by a large
number, it is sometimes convenient to express the former in terms
of one only of its denominations. Thus, to multiply £7, 13s. 6d.
by 469, we may express the former in any of the ways £7.675, <span class="spp">307</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">40</span> of
£1, 153½s., 153.5s., 307 sixpences, or 1842 pence. Expression
in £ and decimals of £1 is usually recommended, but it depends
on circumstances whether some other method may not be simpler.</p>

<p>A sum of money cannot be expressed exactly as a decimal of
£1 unless it is a multiple of ¾d. A rule for approximate conversion
is that 1s. = .05 of £1, and that 2½d.= .01 of £1. For accurate
conversion we write  .1£ for each 2s., and  .001£ for each farthing
beyond 2s., their number being first increased by one twenty-fourth.</p>

<tr><td class="figright1"><img style="width:196px; height:286px" src="images/img539d.jpg" alt="" /></td></tr></table>

<p>106. <i>Division.</i> Of the two kinds of division, although the idea
of partition is perhaps the more elementary, the process of
measuring is the easier to perform, since it is equivalent to a
series of subtractions. Starting from
the dividend, we in theory keep on
subtracting the unit, and count the
number of subtractions that have to
be performed until nothing is left. In
actual practice, of course, we subtract
large multiples at a time. Thus, to
divide 987063 by 427, we reverse the
procedure of § 101, but with intermediate
stages. We first construct the
multiple-table C, and then subtract
successively 200 times, 30 times and
1 times; these numbers being the
<i>partial quotients</i>. The theory of the
process is shown fully in F. Treating x
as the unknown quotient corresponding to the original dividend,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page540" id="page540"></a>540</span>
we obtain successive dividends corresponding to quotients x &minus; 200,
x &minus; 230 and x &minus; 231. The original dividend is written as 0987063,
since its initial figures are greater than those of the divisor; if the
dividend had commenced with (<i>e.g.</i>) 3 ... it would not have
been necessary to insert the initial 0. At each stage of the
division the number of digits in the reduced dividend is decreased
by one. The final dividend being 0000, we have x &minus; 231 = 0, and
therefore x = 231.</p>

<p>107. <i>Methods of Division.</i>&mdash;What are described as different
methods of division (by a single divisor) are mainly different
methods of writing the successive figures occurring in the
process. In <i>long division</i> the divisor is put on the left of the
dividend, and the quotient on the right; and each partial
product, with the remainder after its subtraction, is shown in full.
In <i>short division</i> the divisor and the quotient are placed
respectively on the left of and below the dividend, and the partial
products and remainders are not shown at all. The <i>Austrian</i>
method (sometimes called in Great Britain the <i>Italian</i> method)
differs from these in two respects. The first, and most important,
is that the quotient is placed above the dividend. The second,
which is not essential to the method, is that the remainders are
shown, but not the partial products; the remainders being
obtained by working from the right, and using complementary
addition. It is doubtful whether the brevity of this latter
process really compensates for its greater difficulty.</p>

<div class="center pt2" style="clear: both;">
<img style="width:336px; height:138px" src="images/img540a.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p>The advantage of the Austrian arrangement of the quotient
lies in the indication it gives of the true value of each partial
quotient. A modification of the method, corresponding with D
of § 101, is shown in G; the fact that the partial product 08546 is
followed by two blank spaces shows that the figure 2 represents a
partial quotient 200. An alternative arrangement, corresponding
to E of § 101, and suited for more advanced work, is shown in H.</p>

<p>108. <i>Division with Remainder.</i>&mdash;It has so far been assumed
that the division can be performed exactly, <i>i.e.</i> without leaving
an ultimate remainder. Where this is not the case, difficulties
are apt to arise, which are mainly due to failure to distinguish
between the two kinds of division. If we say that the division of
41d. by 12 gives quotient 3d. with remainder 5d., we are speaking
loosely; for in fact we only distribute 36d. out of the 41d., the
other 5d. remaining undistributed. It can only be distributed by
a subdivision of the unit; <i>i.e.</i> the true result of the division is
3<span class="spp">5</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">12</span>d. On the other hand, we can quite well express the result
of dividing 41d. by 1s (= 12d.) as 3 with 5d. (not &ldquo;5&rdquo;) over, for
this is only stating that 41d. = 3s. 5d.; though the result might
be more exactly expressed as 3<span class="spp">5</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">12</span>s.</p>

<p>Division with a remainder has thus a certain air of unreality,
which is accentuated when the division is performed by means of
factors (§ 42). If we have to divide 935 by 240, taking 12 and 20
as factors, the result will depend on the fact that, in the notation
of § 17, <img style="width:112px; height:30px" src="images/img540d.jpg" alt="" /> In incomplete partition the quotient
is 3, and the remainders 11 and 17 are in effect disregarded; if,
after finding the quotient 3, we want to know what remainder
would be produced by a direct division, the simplest method is to
multiply 3 by 240 and subtract the result from 935. In complete
partition the successive quotients are 77<span class="spp">11</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">12</span> and
3[(17<span class="spp">11</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">12</span>)/20] = 3<span class="spp">215</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">240</span>.
Division in the sense of measuring leads to such a result as
935d. = £3, 17s. 11d.; we may, if we please, express the 17s. 11d.
as 215d., but there is no particular reason why we should do so.</p>

<p>109. <i>Division by a Mixed Number.</i>&mdash;To divide by a mixed
number, when the quotient is seen to be large, it usually saves
time to express the divisor as either a simple fraction or a decimal
of a unit of one of the denominations. Exact division by a mixed
number is not often required in real life; where approximate
division is required (<i>e.g.</i> in determining the rate of a &ldquo;dividend&rdquo;),
approximate expression of the divisor in terms of the largest
unit is sufficient.</p>

<p>110. <i>Calculation of Square Root.</i>&mdash;The calculation of the square
root of a number depends on the formula (iii) of § 60. To find the
square root of N, we first find some number a whose square is less
than N, and subtract a<span class="sp">2</span> from N. If the complete square root is
a + b, the remainder after subtracting a<span class="sp">2</span> is (2a + b)b. We therefore
guess b by dividing the remainder by 2a, and form the
product (2a + b)b. If this is equal to the remainder, we have
found the square root. If it exceeds the square root, we must
alter the value of b, so as to get a product which does not exceed
the remainder. If the product is less than the remainder, we get
a new remainder, which is N &minus; (a + b)<span class="sp">2</span>; we then assume the
full square root to be c, so that the new remainder is equal to
(2a + 2b + c)c, and try to find c in the same way as we tried to
find b.</p>

<p>An analogous method of finding cube root, based on the
formula for (a + b)<span class="sp">3</span>, used to be given in text-books, but it is of no
practical use. To find a root other than a square root we can
use logarithms, as explained in § 113.</p>

<p class="pt1 center">(ii.) <i>Approximate Calculation.</i></p>

<p>111. <i>Multiplication.</i>&mdash;When we have to multiply two numbers,
and the product is only required, or can only be approximately
correct, to a certain number of significant figures, we need only
work to two or three more figures (§ 83), and then correct the final
figure in the result by means of the superfluous figures.</p>

<table class="nobctr" style="float: right; width: 225px;" summary="Illustration">
<tr><td class="figright1"><img style="width:174px; height:186px" src="images/img540b.jpg" alt="" /></td></tr></table>

<p>A common method is to reverse the digits in one of the
numbers; but this is only appropriate to the old-fashioned
method of writing down products from the right. A better method
is to ignore the positions of the decimal points, and multiply
the numbers as if they were decimals
between .1 and 1.0. The method E of
§ 101 being adopted, the multiplicand
and the multiplier are written with a
space after as many digits (of each) as
will be required in the product (on the
principle explained in § 101); and the
multiplication is performed from the left,
two extra figures being kept in. Thus,
to multiply 27.343 by 3.1415927 to one
decimal place, we require 2 + 1 + 1 = 4
figures in the product. The result is 085.9 = 85.9, the position
of the decimal point being determined by counting the figures
before the decimal points in the original numbers.</p>

<p class="nom">&nbsp;</p>

<table class="nobctr" style="float: right; width: 225px;" summary="Illustration">
<tr><td class="figright1"><img style="width:173px; height:246px" src="images/img540c.jpg" alt="" /></td></tr></table>

<p>112. <i>Division</i>.&mdash;In the same way, in
performing approximate division, we can
at a certain stage begin to abbreviate
the divisor, taking off one figure (but
with correction of the final figure of the
partial product) at each stage. Thus, to
divide 85.9 by 3.1415927 to two places
of decimals, we in effect divide .0859 by
.31415927 to four places of decimals. In
the work, as here shown, a 0 is inserted
in front of the 859, on the principle
explained in § 106. The result of the
division is 27.34.</p>

<p>113. <i>Logarithms.</i>&mdash;Multiplication, division, involution and
evolution, when the results cannot be exact, are usually most
simply performed, at any rate to a first approximation, by means
of a table of logarithms. Thus, to find the square root of 2, we
have log &radic;2 = log (2<span class="sp">1/2</span>) = ½ log 2. We take out log 2 from
the table, halve it, and then find from the table the number of
which this is the logarithm. (See <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Logarithm</a></span>.) The <i>slide-rule</i>
(see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Calculating Machines</a></span>) is a simple apparatus for the
mechanical application of the methods of logarithms.</p>

<p>When a first approximation has been obtained in this way,
further approximations can be obtained in various ways. Thus,
having found &radic;2 = 1.414 approximately, we write &radic;2 = 1.414 + &theta;,
whence 2 = (1.414)<span class="sp">2</span> + (2.818)&theta; + &theta;<span class="sp">2</span>.
Since &theta;<span class="sp">2</span> is less than ¼ of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page541" id="page541"></a>541</span>
(.001)<span class="sp">2</span>, we can obtain three more figures approximately by
dividing 2 &minus; (1.414)<span class="sp">2</span> by 2.818.</p>

<p>114. <i>Binomial Theorem.</i>&mdash;More generally, if we have
obtained a as an approximate value for the pth root of N, the
binomial theorem gives as an approximate formula <span class="sp">p</span>&radic;N = a + &theta;,
where N = a<span class="sp">p</span> + pa<span class="sp">p &minus; 1</span>&theta;.</p>

<p>115. <i>Series.</i>&mdash;A number can often be expressed by a series of
terms, such that by taking successive terms we obtain successively
closer approximations. A decimal is of course a series of this
kind, <i>e.g.</i> 3.14159 ... means 3 + 1/10 + 4/10<span class="sp">2</span> + 1/10<span class="sp">3</span> + 5/10<span class="sp">4</span>
+ 9/10<span class="sp">5</span> + ... A series of aliquot parts is another kind, <i>e.g.</i>
3.1416 is a little less than 3 + <span class="spp">1</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">7</span> &minus; <span class="spp">1</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">800</span>.</p>

<p><i>Recurring Decimals</i> are a particular kind of series, which arise
from the expression of a fraction as a decimal. If the denominator
of the fraction, when it is in its lowest terms, contains any
other prime factors than 2 and 5, it cannot be expressed exactly
as a decimal; but after a certain point a definite series of figures
will constantly recur. The interest of these series is, however,
mainly theoretical.</p>

<p>116. <i>Continued Products.</i>&mdash;Instead of being expressed as the
sum of a series of terms, a number may be expressed as the
product of a series of factors, which become successively more and
more nearly equal to 1. For example,</p>

<p class="center">3.1416 = 3 × <span class="spp">10472</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">10000</span> = 3 × <span class="spp">1309</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">1250</span> = 3 × <span class="spp">22</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">21</span> × <span class="spp">2499</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">2500</span> = 3(1 + <span class="spp">1</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">21</span>)(1 &minus; <span class="spp">1</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">2500</span>).</p>

<p class="noind">Hence, to multiply by 3.1416, we can multiply by 3<span class="spp">1</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">7</span>, and subtract
<span class="spp">1</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">2500</span> (= .0004) of the result; or, to divide by 3.1416, we
can divide by 3, then subtract <span class="spp">1</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">22</span> of the result, and then add <span class="spp">1</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">2499</span>
of the new result.</p>

<p>117. <i>Continued Fractions.</i>&mdash;The theory of <i>continued fractions</i>
(<i>q.v.</i>) gives a method of expressing a number, in certain cases,
as a continued product. A continued fraction, of the kind we
are considering, is an expression of the form
<img style="width:122px; height:60px" src="images/img541.jpg" alt="" />
where b, c, d, ... are integers, and a is an integer or zero. The
expression is usually written, for compactness, a + 1/b+ 1/c+ 1/d+ &amp;c.
The numbers a, b, c, d, ... are called the <i>quotients</i>.</p>

<p>Any exact fraction can be expressed as a continued fraction,
and there are methods for expressing as continued fractions
certain other numbers, <i>e.g.</i> square roots, whose values cannot be
expressed exactly as fractions.</p>

<p>The successive values, a/1, (ab + 1)/b, ..., obtained by taking
account of the successive quotients, are called <i>convergents</i>, <i>i.e.</i>
convergents to the true value. The following are the main
properties of the convergents.</p>

<p>(i) If we precede the series of convergents by <span class="spp">0</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">1</span> and <span class="spp">1</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">0</span>, then
the numerator (or denominator) of each term of the series
<span class="spp">0</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">1</span>, <span class="spp">1</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">0</span>, a/1, (ab + 1)/b ..., after the first two, is found by multiplying
the numerator (or denominator) of the last preceding term by the
corresponding quotient and adding the numerator (or denominator)
of the term before that. If a is zero, we may regard 1/b
as the first convergent, and precede the series by <span class="spp">1</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">0</span> and <span class="spp">0</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">1</span>.</p>

<p>(ii) Each convergent is a fraction in its lowest terms.</p>

<p>(iii) The convergents are alternately less and greater than the
true value.</p>

<p>(iv) Each convergent is nearer to the true value than any other
fraction whose denominator is less than that of the convergent.</p>

<p>(v) The difference of two successive convergents is the reciprocal
of the product of their denominators; <i>e.g.</i> (ab + 1)/b &minus; a/1 = 1/(1·b), and
(abc + c + a)/(bc + 1) &minus; (ab + 1)/b = &minus;1/b(bc + 1).</p>

<p>It follows from these last three properties that if the successive
convergents are p<span class="su">1</span>/1, p<span class="su">2</span>/q<span class="su">2</span>, p<span class="su">3</span>/q<span class="su">3</span>, ... the number can be expressed
in the form p<span class="su">1</span>(1 + 1/p<span class="su">1</span>q<span class="su">2</span>) (1 &minus; 1/p<span class="su">2</span>q<span class="su">3</span>) (1 + 1/p<span class="su">3</span>q<span class="su">4</span>) ..., and that if
we go up to the factor 1 ± 1/(p<span class="su">n</span>q<span class="su">n + 1</span>) the product of these factors
differs from the true value of the number by less than ±{1/(q<span class="su">n</span>q<span class="su">n + 1</span>).</p>

<p>In certain cases two or more factors can be combined so as to
produce an expression of the form 1 ± 1/k, where k is an integer.
For instance, 3.1415927 = 3(1 + <span class="spp">1</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">3.7</span>) (1 &minus; <span class="spp">1</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">22.106</span>) (1 + <span class="spp">1</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">333.113</span>) ...;
but the last two of these factors may be combined as (1 &minus; <span class="spp">1</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">22.113</span>).
Hence 3.1415927 = <span class="spp">3</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">1</span> · <span class="spp">22</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">21</span> · <span class="spp">2485</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">2486</span> ...</p>

<p class="pt1 center">(i.) <i>Systems of Measures.</i><a name="fa1i" id="fa1i" href="#ft1i"><span class="sp">1</span></a></p>

<p>118. <i>Metric System.</i>&mdash;The metric system was adopted in
France at the end of the 18th century. The system is decimal
throughout. The principal units of length, weight and volume
are the <i>metre, gramme</i> (or <i>gram</i>) and <i>litre</i>. Other units are
derived from these by multiplication or division by powers of 10,
the names being denoted by prefixes. The prefixes for multiplication
by 10, 10<span class="sp">2</span>, 10<span class="sp">3</span> and 10<span class="sp">4</span> are <i>deca-</i>, <i>hecto-</i>, <i>kilo-</i> and <i>myria-</i>,
and those for division by 10, 10<span class="sp">2</span> and 10<span class="sp">3</span> are <i>deci-</i>, <i>centi-</i> and
<i>milli-</i>; the former being derived from Greek, and the latter from
Latin. Thus <i>kilogramme</i> means 1000 grammes, and <i>centimetre</i>
means <span class="spp">1</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">100</span> of a metre. There are also certain special units, such
as the <i>hectare</i>, which is equal to a square hectometre, and the
<i>micron</i>, which is <span class="spp">1</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">1000</span> of a millimetre.</p>

<p>The metre and the gramme are defined by standard measures
preserved at Paris. The litre is equal to a cubic decimetre. The
gramme was intended to be equal to the weight of a cubic centimetre
of pure water at a certain temperature, but the equality is
only approximate.</p>

<p>The metric system is now in use in the greater part of the
civilized world, but some of the measures retain the names of
old disused measures. In Germany, for instance, the <i>Pfund</i> is
½ kilogramme, and is approximately equal to 1<span class="spp">1</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">10</span> &#8468; English.</p>

<p>119. <i>British Systems.</i>&mdash;The British systems have various
origins, and are still subject to variations caused by local usage
or by the usage of particular businesses. The following tables are
given as illustrations of the arrangement adopted elsewhere in
this article; the entries in any column denote multiples or submultiples
of the unit stated at the head of the column, and the
entries in any row give the expression of one unit in term of
the other units.</p>

<p class="pt1 center">(ii.) <i>Special Applications.</i></p>

<p>121. <i>Commercial Arithmetic.</i>&mdash;This term covers practically all
dealings with money which involve the application of the principle
of proportion. A simple class of cases is that which deals
with equivalence of sums of money in different currencies; these
cases really come under § 120. In other cases we are concerned
with a proportion stated as a <i>numerical percentage</i>, or as a <i>money
percentage</i> (<i>i.e.</i> a sum of money per £100), or as a <i>rate</i> in the £ or
the shilling. The following are some examples. Percentage:
<i>Brokerage, commission, discount, dividend, interest, investment,
profit and loss.</i> Rate in the £: <i>Discount, dividend, rates, taxes.</i>
Rate in the shilling: <i>Discount.</i></p>

<p>Text-books on arithmetic usually contain explanations of the
chief commercial transactions in which arithmetical calculations
arise; it will be sufficient in the present article to deal with
interest and discount, and to give some notes on percentages and
rates in the £. <i>Insurance</i> and <i>Annuities</i> are matters of general
importance, which are dealt with elsewhere under their own headings.</p>

<p>122. <i>Percentages and Rates in the £.</i>&mdash;In dealing with
percentages and rates it is important to notice whether the sum which is
expressed as a percentage of a rate on another sum is a part of or
an addition to that sum, or whether they are independent of one
another. Income tax, for instance, is calculated on income, and
is in the nature of a deduction from the income; but local rates
are calculated in proportion to certain other payments, actual
or potential, and could without absurdity exceed 20s. in the £.</p>

<p>It is also important to note that if the increase or decrease of an
amount A by a certain percentage produces B, it will require a
different percentage to decrease or increase B to A. Thus, if B is
20% less than A, A is 25% greater than B.</p>

<p>123. <i>Interest</i> is usually calculated yearly or half-yearly, at a
certain rate per cent. on the principal. In legal documents the
rate is sometimes expressed as a certain sum of money &ldquo;per
centum per annum&rdquo;; here &ldquo;centum&rdquo; must be taken to mean &ldquo;£100.&rdquo;</p>

<p><i>Simple interest</i> arises where unpaid interest accumulates as a
debt not itself bearing interest; but, if this debt bears interest,
the total, <i>i.e.</i> interest and interest on interest, is called <i>compound
interest.</i> If 100r is the rate per cent. per annum, the simple
interest on £A for n years is £nrA, and the compound interest
(supposing interest payable yearly) is £[(1 + r)<span class="sp">n</span> &minus; 1]A. If n is
large, the compound interest is most easily calculated by means
of logarithms.</p>

<p>124. <i>Discount</i> is of various kinds. Tradesmen allow discount
for ready money, this being usually at so much in the shilling or £.
Discount may be allowed twice in succession off quoted prices; in
such cases the second discount is off the reduced price, and
therefore it is not correct to add the two rates of discount together.
Thus a discount of 20%, followed by a further discount of 25%,
gives a total discount of 40%, not 45%, off the original amount.
When an amount will fall due at some future date, the <i>present
value</i> of the debt is found by deducting discount at some rate per
cent. for the intervening period, in the same way as interest to be
added is calculated. This discount, of course, is not equal to the
interest which the present value would produce at that rate of
interest, but is rather greater, so that the present value as
calculated in this way is less than the theoretical present value.</p>

<p>125. Applications to <i>Physics</i> are numerous, but are usually
only of special interest. A case of general interest is the
measurement of <i>temperature.</i> The graduation of a thermometer is
determined by the freezing-point and the boiling-point of water,
the interval between these being divided into a certain number
of degrees, representing equal increases of temperature. On the
Fahrenheit scale the points are respectively 32° and 212°; on the
Centigrade scale they are 0° and 100°; and on the Réaumur they
are 0° and 80°. From these data a temperature as measured on
one scale can be expressed on either of the other two scales.</p>

<p>126. <i>Averages</i> occur in statistics, economics, &amp;c. An average
is found by adding together several measurements of the same
kind and dividing by the number of measurements. In calculating
an average it should be observed that the addition of any
numerical quantity (positive or negative) to each of the measurements
produces the addition of the same quantity to the average,
so that the calculation may often be simplified by taking some particular
measurement as a new zero from which to measure.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Authorities</span>.&mdash;For the history of the subject, see W.W.R. Ball,
<i>Short History of Mathematics</i> (1901), and F. Cajori, <i>History of
Elementary Mathematics</i> (1896); or more detailed information in
M. Cantor, <i>Vorlesungen über Geschichte der Mathematik</i> (1894-1901).
L.C. Conant, <i>The Number-Concept</i> (1896), gives a very full account of
systems of numeration. For the latter, and for systems of notation,
reference may also be made to Peacock&rsquo;s article &ldquo;Arithmetic&rdquo; in the
<i>Encyclopaedia Metropolitana</i>, which contains a detailed account of
the Greek system. F. Galton, <i>Inquiries into Human Faculty</i> (1883),
contains the first account of number-forms; for further examples and
references see D.E. Phillips, &ldquo;Genesis of Number-Forms,&rdquo; <i>American
Journal of Psychology</i>, vol. viii. (1897). There are very few works
dealing adequately but simply with the principles of arithmetic.
Homersham Cox, <i>Principles of Arithmetic</i> (1885), is brief and lucid,
but is out of print. <i>The Psychology of Number</i>, by J.A. McLellan and
J. Dewey (1895), contains valuable suggestions (some of which have
been utilized in the present article), but it deals only with number as
the measure of quantity, and requires to be read critically. This
work contains references to Grube&rsquo;s system, which has been much
discussed in America: for a brief explanation, see L. Seeley, <i>The Grube
Method of Teaching Arithmetic</i> (1890). On the teaching of arithmetic,
and of elementary mathematics generally, see J.W.A. Young, <i>The
Teaching of Mathematics in the Elementary and the Secondary School</i>
(1907); D.E. Smith, <i>The Teaching of Elementary Mathematics</i> (1900),
also contains an interesting general sketch; W.P. Turnbull, <i>The
Teaching of Arithmetic</i> (1903), is more elaborate. E.M. Langley,
<i>A Treatise on Computation</i> (1895), has notes on approximate and
abbreviated calculation. Text-books on arithmetic in general and
on particular applications are numerous, and any list would soon be
out of date. Recent English works have been influenced by the brief
<i>Report on the Teaching of Elementary Mathematics</i>, issued by the
Mathematical Association (1905); but this is critical rather than
constructive. The Association has also issued a <i>Report on the Teaching
of Mathematics in Preparatory Schools</i> (1907). In the United States
of America the <i>Report of the Committee of Ten</i> on secondary school
studies (1893) and the <i>Report of the Committee of Fifteen</i> on elementary
education (1893-1894), both issued by the United States Bureau of
Education, have attracted a good deal of attention. Sir O. Lodge,
<i>Easy Mathematics, chiefly Arithmetic</i> (1905), treats the subject
broadly in its practical aspects. The student who is interested
in elementary teaching should consult the annual bibliographies in
the <i>Pedagogical Seminary</i>; an article by D.E. Phillips in vol. v.
(October 1897) contains references to works dealing with the psychological
aspect of number. For an account of German methods, see
W. King, <i>Report on Teaching of Arithmetic and Mathematics in the
Higher Schools of Germany</i> (1903).</p>

<p><span class="bold">ARIUS<a name="ar109" id="ar109"></a></span> (<span class="grk" title="Areios">&#7948;&#961;&#949;&#953;&#959;&#962;</span>), a name celebrated in ecclesiastical history,
not so much on account of the personality of its bearer as of the
&ldquo;Arian&rdquo; controversy which he provoked. Our knowledge of
Arius is scanty, and nothing certain is known of his birth or of his
early training. Epiphanius of Salamis, in his well-known treatise
against eighty heresies (<i>Haer.</i> lxix. 3), calls him a Libyan by
birth, and if the statement of Sozomen, a church historian of
the 5th century, is to be trusted, he was, as a member of the
Alexandrian church, connected with the Meletian schism (see
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page543" id="page543"></a>543</span>
<span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Meletius of Lycopolis</a></span>), and on this account excommunicated
by Peter of Alexandria, who had ordained him deacon. After
the death of Peter (November 25, 311), he was received into
communion by Peter&rsquo;s successor, Achillas, elevated to the
presbytery, and put in charge of one of the great city churches,
Baucalis, where he continued to discharge his duties with
apparent faithfulness and industry after the accession of
Alexander. This bishop also held him in high repute. Theodoret
(<i>Hist. Eccl.</i> i. 2) indeed does not hesitate to say that Arius
was chagrined because Alexander, instead of himself, had been
appointed to the see of Alexandria, and that the beginning of
his heretical attitude is, in consequence, to be attributed to
discontent and envy. But this must be rejected, for it is a
common explanation of heretical movements with the early
church historians, and there is no evidence for it in the original
sources. However, Arius was ambitious. Epiphanius, using
older documents, describes him as a man inflamed with his own
opinionativeness, of a soft and smooth address, calculated to
persuade and attract, especially women: &ldquo;in no time he had
drawn away seven hundred virgins from the church to his
party.&rdquo; When the controversy broke out, Arius was an old man.</p>

<p>The real causes of the controversy lay in differences as to
dogma. Arius had received his theological education in the
school of the presbyter Lucian of Antioch, a learned man, and
distinguished especially as a biblical scholar. The latter was a
follower of Paul of Samosata, bishop of Antioch, who had been
excommunicated in 269, but his theology differed from that of his
master in a fundamental point. Paul, starting with the conviction
that the One God cannot appear substantially (<span class="grk" title="ousiodos">&#959;&#8016;&#963;&#953;&#969;&#948;&#8182;&#962;</span>)
on earth, and, consequently, that he cannot have become a
person in Jesus Christ, had taught that God had filled the man
Jesus with his Logos (<span class="grk" title="sophia">&#963;&#959;&#966;&#943;&#945;</span>) or Power (<span class="grk" title="dynamis">&#948;&#973;&#957;&#945;&#956;&#953;&#962;</span>). Lucian, on the
other hand, persisted in holding that the Logos became a person
in Christ. But since he shared the above-mentioned belief of his
master, nothing remained for him but to see in the Logos a second
essence, created by God before the world, which came down to
earth and took upon itself a human body. In this body the
Logos filled the place of the intellectual or spiritual principle.
Lucian&rsquo;s Christ, then, was not &ldquo;perfect man,&rdquo; for that which
constituted in him the personal element was a divine essence;
nor was he &ldquo;perfect God,&rdquo; for the divine essence having become
a person was other than the One God, and of a nature foreign to
him. It is this idea which Arius took up and interpreted unintelligently.
His doctrinal position is explained in his letters to
his patron Eusebius, bishop of the imperial city of Nicomedia,
and to Alexander of Alexandria, and in the fragments of the
poem in which he set forth his dogmas, which bears the enigmatic
title of &ldquo;Thalia&rdquo; (<span class="grk" title="Thaleia">&#952;&#940;&#955;&#949;&#953;&#945;</span>), used in Homer, in the sense of
&ldquo;a goodly banquet,&rdquo; most unjustly ridiculed by Athanasius as
an imitation of the licentious style of the drinking-songs of the
Egyptian Sotades (270 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>). From these writings it can even
nowadays be seen clearly that the principal object which he had
in view was firmly to establish the unity and simplicity of the
eternal God. However far the Son may surpass other created
beings, he remains himself a created being, to whom the Father
before all time gave an existence formed out of not being (<span class="grk" title="ex ouk
onton">&#7952;&#958; &#959;&#8016;&#954; &#8004;&#957;&#964;&#969;&#957;</span>); hence the name of <i>Exoukontians</i> sometimes given to
Arius&rsquo;s followers. On the other hand, Arius affirmed of the Son
that he was &ldquo;perfect God, only-begotten&rdquo; (<span class="grk" title="plaeraes theos monogenaes">&#960;&#955;&#942;&#961;&#951;&#962; &#952;&#949;&#8056;&#962; &#956;&#959;&#957;&#959;&#947;&#949;&#957;&#942;&#962;</span>);
that through him God made the worlds (<span class="grk" title="aiones">&#945;&#7984;&#8182;&#957;&#949;&#962;</span>, ages);
that he was the product or offspring of the Father, and yet
not as one among things made (<span class="grk" title="gennaema all ouch ton
gegenaemenon">&#947;&#941;&#957;&#957;&#951;&#956;&#945; &#7936;&#955;&#955;&#8125; &#959;&#8016;&#967; &#8033;&#962; &#7955;&#957; &#964;&#8036;&#957; &#947;&#949;&#947;&#949;&#957;&#951;&#956;&#941;&#957;&#969;&#957;</span>). In his eyes it was blasphemy when he heard that
Alexander proclaimed in public that &ldquo;as God is eternal, so is his
Son,&mdash;when the Father, then the Son,&mdash;the Son is present in
God without birth (<span class="grk" title="agennaetos">&#7936;&#947;&#949;&#957;&#957;&#942;&#964;&#969;&#962;</span>), ever-begotten (<span class="grk" title="aeigenaes">&#7936;&#949;&#953;&#947;&#949;&#957;&#942;&#962;</span>), an
unbegotten-begotten (<span class="grk" title="agennaetogenaes">&#7936;&#947;&#949;&#957;&#957;&#951;&#964;&#959;&#947;&#949;&#957;&#942;&#962;</span>).&rdquo; He detected in his
bishop Gnosticism, Manichaeism and Sabellianism, and was
convinced that he himself was the champion of pure doctrine
against heresy. He was quite unconscious that his own monotheism
was hardly to be distinguished from that of the pagan
philosophers, and that his Christ was a demi-god.</p>

<p>For years the controversy may have been fermenting in
the college of presbyters at Alexandria. Sozomen relates that
Alexander only interfered after being charged with remissness in
leaving Arius so long to disturb the faith of the church. According
to the general supposition, the negotiations which led to the
excommunication of Arius and his followers among the presbyters
and deacons took place in 318 or 319, but there are good reasons
for assigning the outbreak of the controversy to the time following
the overthrow of Licinius by Constantine, <i>i.e.</i> to the year
323. In any case, from this time events followed one another
to a speedy conclusion. Arius was not without adherents, even
outside Alexandria. Those bishops who, like him, had passed
through the school of Lucian were not inclined to let him fall
without a struggle, as they recognized in the views of their
fellow-student their own doctrine, only set forth in a somewhat
radical fashion. In addressing to Eusebius of Nicomedia a
request for his help, Arius ended with the words: &ldquo;Be mindful
of our adversity, thou faithful comrade of Lucian&rsquo;s school
(<span class="grk" title="sulloukianistaes">&#963;&#965;&#955;&#955;&#959;&#965;&#954;&#953;&#945;&#957;&#953;&#963;&#964;&#942;&#962;</span>)&rdquo;; and Eusebius entered the lists energetically
on his behalf. But Alexander too was active; by means of a
circular letter he published abroad the excommunication of his
presbyter, and the controversy excited more and more general
interest.</p>

<p>It reached even the ears of Constantine. Now sole emperor,
he saw in the one Catholic church the best means of counteracting
the movement in his vast empire towards disintegration;
and he at once realized how dangerous dogmatic squabbles might
prove to its unity. His letter, preserved by the imperial
biographer, Eusebius of Caesarea, is a state document inspired by
a wisely conciliatory policy; it made out both parties to be
equally in the right and in the wrong, at the same time giving
them both to understand that such questions, the meaning of
which would be grasped only by the few, had better not be
brought into public discussion; it was advisable to come to an
agreement where the difference of opinion was not fundamental.
This well-meaning attempt at reconciliation, betraying as it did
no very deep understanding of the question, came to nothing.
No course was left for the emperor except to obtain a general
decision. This took, place at the fist oecumenical council, which
was convened in Nicaea (<i>q.v.</i>) in 325. After various turns in the
controversy, it was finally decided, against Arius, that the Son
was &ldquo;of the same substance&rdquo; (<span class="grk" title="homoousios">&#8001;&#956;&#959;&#959;&#973;&#963;&#953;&#959;&#962;</span>) with the Father,
and all thought of his being created or even subordinate had to
be excluded. Constantine accepted the decision of the council
and resolved to uphold it. Arius and the two bishops of
Marmarica Ptolemais, who refused to subscribe the creed,
were excommunicated and banished to Illyria, and even Eusebius
of Nicomedia, who accepted the creed, but not its anathemas,
was exiled to Gaul. Alexander returned to his see triumphant,
but died soon after, and was succeeded by Athanasius (<i>q.v.</i>), his
deacon, with whose indomitable fortitude and strange vicissitudes
the further course of the controversy is bound up.</p>

<p>It only remains for us here to sketch what is known of the future
career of Arius and the Arians. Although defeated at the council
of Nicaea, the Arians were by no means subdued. Constantine,
while strongly disposed at first to enforce the Nicene decrees,
was gradually won to a more conciliatory policy by the influence
especially of Eusebius of Caesarea and Eusebius of Nicomedia,
the latter of whom returned from exile in 328 and won the ear
of the emperor, whom he baptized on his death-bed. In 330
even Arius was recalled from banishment. Athanasius, on the
other hand, was banished to Trèves in 335. During his absence
Arius returned to Alexandria, but even now the people are said
to have raised a fierce riot against the heretic. In 336 the emperor
was forced to summon him to Constantinople. Bishop Alexander
reluctantly assented to receive him once more into the bosom of
the church, but before the act of admission was completed, Arius
was suddenly taken ill while walking in the streets, and died in a
few moments. His death seems to have exercised no influence
worth speaking of on the course of events. His theological
radicalism had in any case never found many convinced adherents.
It was mainly the opposition to the Homoousios, as a formula
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page544" id="page544"></a>544</span>
open to heretical misinterpretation, and not borne out by Holy
Writ, which kept together the large party known as Semiarians,
who under the leadership of the two Eusebiuses carried on the
strife against the Nicenes and especially Athanasius. Under the
sons of Constantine Christian bishops in numberless synods
cursed one another turn by turn. In the western half of the
empire Arianism found no foothold, and even the despotic will
of Constantius, sole emperor after 351, succeeded only for the
moment in subduing the bishops exiled for the sake of their
belief. In the east, on the other hand, the Semiarians had for
long the upper hand. They soon split up into different groups,
according as they came to stand nearer to or farther from the
original position of Arius. The actual centre was formed by the
<i>Homoii</i>, who only spoke generally of a likeness <span class="grk" title="homoiotaes">&#8001;&#956;&#959;&#953;&#972;&#964;&#951;&#962;</span> of the
Son to the Father; to the left of them were the <i>Anomoii</i>, who,
with Arius, held the Son to be unlike <span class="grk" title="anomoios">&#7936;&#957;&#972;&#956;&#959;&#953;&#959;&#962;</span> the Father;
to the right, the <i>Homoiousians</i> who, taking as their catchword
&ldquo;likeness of nature&rdquo; <span class="grk" title="homoiotaes kat ousian">&#8001;&#956;&#959;&#953;&#972;&#964;&#951;&#962; &#954;&#945;&#964;&#8125; &#959;&#8016;&#963;&#943;&#945;&#957;</span>, thought that they
could preserve the religious content of the Nicene formula without
having to adopt the formula itself. Since this party in
the course of years came more and more into sympathy with
the representatives of the Nicene party, the <i>Homoousians</i>,
and notably with Athanasius, the much-disputed formula
became more and more popular, till the council summoned in
381 at Constantinople, under the auspices of Theodosius the
Great, recognized the Nicene doctrine as the only orthodox one.
Arianism, which had lifted up its head again under the emperor
Valens, was thereby thrust out of the state church. It lived to
flourish anew among the Germanic tribes at the time of the great
migrations. Goths, Vandals, Suebi, Burgundians and Langobardi
embraced it; here too as a distinctive national type of
Christianity it perished before the growth of medieval Catholicism,
and the name of Arian ceased to represent a definite form
of Christian doctrine within the church, or a definite party
outside it.</p>

<p><span class="bold">ARIZONA<a name="ar110" id="ar110"></a></span> (from the Spanish-Indian <i>Arizonac</i>, of unknown
meaning,&mdash;possibly &ldquo;few springs,&rdquo;&mdash;the name of an 18th-century
mining camp in the Santa Cruz valley, just S. of the present
border of Arizona), a state on the S.W. border of the United
States of America, lying between 31° 20&prime; and 37° N. lat. and
109° 2&prime; and 114° 45&prime; W. long. It is bounded N. by Utah, E. by
New Mexico, S. by Mexico and W. by California and Nevada,
the Colorado river separating it from California and in part from
Nevada. On the W. is the Great Basin. Arizona itself is mostly
included in the great arid mountainous uplift of the Rocky
Mountain region, and partly within the desert plain region of
the Gulf of California, or Open Basin region. The whole state
lies on the south-western exposure of a great roof whose crest,
along the continental divide in western New Mexico, pitches
southward. Its altitudes vary from 12,800 ft. to less than 100 ft.
above the sea. Of its total area of 113,956 sq. m. (water surface,
116 sq. m.), approximately 39,000 lie below 3000 ft., 27,000 from
3000 to 5000 ft., and 47,000 above 5000 ft.</p>

<p><i>Physical Features.</i>&mdash;Three characteristic physiographic regions
are distinctly marked: first the great Colorado Plateau, some
45,000 sq. m. in area, embracing all the region N. and E. of a line
drawn from the Grand Wash Cliffs in the N.W. corner of the
state to its E. border near Clifton; next a broad zone of
compacted mountain ranges with a southern limit of similar
trend; and lastly a region of desert plains, occupying somewhat
more than the S.W. quarter of the state. The plateau region
has an average elevation of 6000-8000 ft. eastward, but it is
much broken down in the west. The plateau is not a plain. It is
dominated by high mountains, gashed by superb canyons of
rivers, scarred with dry gullies and washes, the beds of intermittent
streams, varied with great shallow basins, sunken deserts,
dreary levels, bold buttes, picturesque mesas, forests and rare
verdant bits of valley. In the N.W. there is a giddy drop into
the tremendous cut of the Grand Canyon (<i>q.v.</i>) of the Colorado
river. The surface in general is rolling, with a gentle slope northward,
and drains through the Little Colorado (or Colorado
Chiquito), Rio Puerco and other streams into the Grand Canyon.
Along the Colorado is the Painted Desert, remarkable for the
bright colours&mdash;red, brown, blue, purple, yellow and white&mdash;of
its sandstones, shales and clays. Within the desert is a petrified
forest, the most remarkable in the United States. The trees
are of mesozoic time, though mostly washed down to the foot of
the mesas in which they were once embedded, and lying now
amid deposits of a later age. Blocks and logs of agate, chalcedony,
jasper, opal and other silicate deposits lie in hundreds
over an area of 60 sq. m. The forest is now protected as a
national reserve against vandalism and commercialism. Everywhere
are evidences of water and wind erosion, of desiccation
and differential weathering. This is the history of the mesas,
which are the most characteristic scenic feature of the highlands.
The marks of volcanic action, particularly lava-flows, are also
abundant and widely scattered.</p>

<p>Separating the plateau from the mountain region is an abrupt
transition slope, often deeply eroded, crossing the entire state as
has been indicated. In localities the slope is a true escarpment
falling 150 and even 250 ft. per mile. In the Aubrey Cliffs and
along the Mogollon mesa, which for about 200 m. parts the waters
of the Gila and the Little Colorado, it often has an elevation
of 1000 to 2000 ft., and the ascent is impracticable through long
distances to the most daring climber. It is not of course everywhere
so remarkable, or even distinct, and especially after its
trend turns southward W. of Clifton, it is much broken down and
obscured by erosion and lava deposits. The mountain region
has a width of 70 to 150 m., and is filled with short parallel
ranges trending parallel to the plateau escarpment. Many of
the mountains are extinct volcanoes. In the San Francisco
mountains, in the north central part of the state, three peaks
rise to from 10,000 to 12,794 ft.; three others are above 9000 ft.;
all are eruptive cones, and among the lesser summits are old
cinder cones. The S.E. corner of Arizona is a region of
greatly eroded ranges and gentle aggraded valleys. This mountain
zone has an average elevation of not less than 4000 ft.,
while in places its crests are 5000 ft. above the plains below. The
line dividing the two regions runs roughly from Nogales on the
Mexican border, past Tucson, Florence and Phoenix to Needles
(California), on the W. boundary. These plains, the third or desert
region of the state, have their mountains also, but they are
lower, and they are not compacted; the plains near the mountain
region slope toward the Gulf of California across wide valleys
separated by isolated ranges, then across broad desert stretches
traversed by rocky ridges, and finally there is no obstruction to
the slope at all. Small parts of the desert along the Mexican
boundary are shifting sand.</p>

<p class="noind f80"><a href="images/img544a.jpg">(Click to enlarge.)</a></p>

<p class="pt2"><i>Climate.</i>&mdash;As may be inferred from the physical description,
Arizona has a wide variety of local climates. In general it is
characterized by wonderfully clear air and extraordinarily low
humidity. The scanty rainfall is distributed from July to April,
with marked excess from July to September and a lesser maximum
in December. May and June are very dry. Often during
a month, sometimes for several months, no rain falls over the
greatest part of Arizona. Very little rain comes from the
Pacific or the Gulf of California, the mountains and desert, as
well as the adverse winds, making it impossible. Rain and snow
fall usually from clouds blown from the Gulf of Mexico and not
wholly dried in Texas. The mountainous areas are the only ones
of adequate precipitation; the northern slope of the Colorado
Plateau is almost destitute of water; the region of least precipitation
is the &ldquo;desert&rdquo; region. The mean annual rainfall
varies from amounts of 2 to 5.5 in. at various points in the
lower gulf valley, and on the western border to amounts of 25 to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page545" id="page545"></a>545</span>
30 in. in the mountains. The highest recorded maximum in
Arizona is 35 in. The proportion of perfectly clear days in
the year varies at different points from a half to two-thirds;
of the rest not more than half are without brilliant sunshine
part of the day. Local thunderstorms and cloud-bursts are
a characteristic phenomenon, inundating limited areas and
transforming dried-up streams into muddy torrents carrying
boulders and débris. Often in the plateau country the dry under-air
absorbs the rain as it falls; and rarely in the Hopi Country
do flooded gullies &ldquo;run through&rdquo; to the Little Colorado. The
country of the cliff-dwellers in the N.E. is desert-like. Only
points high in altitude catch much rain. Mountain snows feed
the Gila, the Little Colorado, and the Colorado rivers. The
Colorado, apart from the Gila, draws little water from Arizona.
The mountain zone W. of Prescott drains into the Colorado,
and to the S. and E. into the Gila; and the latter is by far the
heavier drainage in volume. The floods come in May and June,
and during the wet season the rivers, all with steep beds in their
upper courses, wash along detritus that lower down narrows,
and on smaller streams almost chokes, their courses. These
gradients enable the inconstant streams tributary to the Colorado
to carve their canyons, some of which are in themselves very
remarkable, though insignificant beside the Grand Canyon. Many
streams that are turned in spring or by summer cloud-bursts
into torrents are normally mere water films or dry gulches.
Even the Gila is dry in its bed part of the year at its mouth near
Yuma. From the Gila to the southern boundary the parched
land gives no water to the sea, and the international boundary
runs in part through a true desert. In the hot season there
is almost no surface water. Artesian wells are used in places,
as in the stock country of the Baboquivari valley.</p>

<p>The temperature of Arizona is somewhat higher than that of
points of equal latitude on the Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico
coasts. In the mountains on the plateau it ranges from that of the
temperate zone to that of regions of perpetual snow; S. of the
mountains it ranges from temperate heats in the foothills to
semi-tropic heat in the lower valleys of the Gila and Colorado.
The average annual temperature over the region N. of 34&prime; N.
is about 55°; that of the region S. is about 68°. The warmest
region is the lower Gila valley. Here the hottest temperature of
the year hovers around 130°, the mean for the hottest month
(July) is about 98°, and the mean for the year is from 68.9°-74.4° F.
at different points. Some parts of the Santa Cruz
valley are equally hot. In the hottest (western) portions of the
true desert on the Mexican border the daily maximum temperature
is about 110° F.; but owing to the rapid radiation in the
dry, clear, cloudless air the temperature frequently falls 40-50°
in the night. The coldest points on the high plateau have annual
means as low as 45-48°, and a mean for the coldest month at
times below 20° F. The range from high to low extreme on the
plateau may be as great as 125°, but in the S.W. it is only about
70-80° F. The daily variation (not uncommonly 60° F.) is of
course greatest in the most arid regions, where radiation is most
rapid. And of all Arizona it should be said that owing to
the extreme dryness of the air, evaporation from moist surfaces
is very rapid,<a name="fa1j" id="fa1j" href="#ft1j"><span class="sp">1</span></a> so that the high temperatures here are decidedly
less oppressive than much lower temperatures in a humid
atmosphere. The great difference between absolute and sensible
temperature is a very important climatic characteristic of
Arizona. Generally speaking, during two-thirds of the year the
temperature is really delightful; the nights are cool, the mornings
bracing, the days mild though splendid. Intense heat prevails
in July, August and September. In lowness of humidity (mean
annual relative humidity at Yuma about 39, at Phoenix 36.7,
at Tucson 37.8) and clarity of atmosphere, southern Arizona
rivals Upper Egypt and other famous arid health resorts.</p>

<p><i>Fauna and Flora.</i>&mdash;Within the borders of Arizona are areas
representative of every life zone save the humid tropical. From
the summit of the San Francisco Mountains one may pass rapidly
through all these down into the Painted Desert. The Boreal-Canadian,
Transition and Upper Sonoran embrace the highlands.
Coyotes are very common; wild cats and mountain lions are
fairly plentiful. Deer and antelope are represented by various
species. Prairie-dogs, jack-rabbits, crows and occasional ravens,
quail, grouse, pheasants and wild turkeys are also noteworthy in
a rather scant animal life. Characteristic forms of the Upper
Sonoran zone are the burrowing owl, Nevada sage-thrush,
sage-thrasher and special species of orioles, kangaroo rats, mice,
rabbits and squirrels. The Lower Sonoran covers the greatest
part of southern and western Arizona, as well as the immediate
valleys of the Colorado and Little Colorado rivers. Its animal
life is in the main distinguished in species only from that of the
Upper Sonoran belt, including among birds, the desert sparrow,
desert thrasher, mocking-bird, hooded oriole; and among
mammals small nocturnal species of kangaroo rats, pocket mice,
mice and bats. Jaguars occasionally stray into Arizona from
Mexico. Lizards and toads are conspicuous in the more desert
areas. Snakes are not numerous. The Gila-monster, tarantula,
the scorpion and thelyphonus, scolopender and julus occur in
some localities in the rainy season. The Arid-Tropical zone is
represented by a narrow belt along the lower Colorado river, with
a short arm extending into the valley of the Gila. The country
is so arid that it supports only desert birds and mammals.
Camels were very successfully employed as pack animals on the
Tule desert in the palmy days of Virginia City, Nevada, before the
advent of railways.</p>

<p>The general conditions of distribution of the fauna of Arizona
are shown even more distinctly by the flora. There are firs and
spruces on the mountains, characteristic of the Boreal zone; pines
characteristic of the Transition zone; piñon juniper, greasewood
and the universally conspicuous sage-brush, characteristic of the
Upper Sonoran zone. In the Lower Sonoran belt, soapweed,
acacias (Palo Verde or <i>Parkinsonia torreyana</i>), agaves, yuccas
and dasylirions, the creosote bush and mesquite tree, candle
wood, and about seventy-five species of cactuses&mdash;among them
omnipresent opuntiae and great columnar &ldquo;Chayas&rdquo;&mdash;make up
a striking vegetation, which in its colours of dull grey and olive
harmonizes well with the rigidity and forbidding barrenness
of the plains. It has exercised profound influence upon the
industries, arts, faiths and general culture of the Indians. In
places the giant cactus grows in groves, attaining a height of
40 and even 50 ft. The mesquite varies in size from a tangled
thorny shrub to a spreading tree as much as 3 ft. in diameter
and 50 ft. high; it is normally perhaps half as high, and 6-8 in.
in diameter. Enduring hardily great extremes of heat and
moisture, it is throughout the arid South-west the most important,
and in many localities the only important, native tree. From
the great juicy, leafless, branchless stalk of the yucca, soap is
prepared, and strong fibres useful in making paper, rope and
fabrics. The fibre of the agave is also made into rope and its
juice into pulque. The canaigre grows wild and is also cultivated.
It is easy to exaggerate greatly the barrenness of an arid country.
There are fine indigenous grasses that spring up over the mesas
after the summer rains, furnishing range for live-stock; some are
extraordinarily independent of the rainfall. In the most arid
regions there is a small growth of green in the rainy season, and a
rich display of small wild-flowers, as well as the enormous flower
clusters of the yucca, and blooms in pink and orange, crimson,
yellow and scarlet of the giant cactus and its fellows. Even in the
Mexican border, desert oak, juniper and manzanita cover the
mountains, and there is a vigorous though short-lived growth
of grasses and flower from July to October. The cliff-dweller
country supports a scant vegetation&mdash;a few cottonwood in the
washes, a few cedars on the mesas.</p>

<p>Continuous forest areas are scant. A fair variety of trees&mdash;cottonwood,
sycamore, ash, willow, walnut and cherry&mdash;grow
in thickets in the canyons, and each mountain range is a forest
area. Rainfall varying with the altitude, the lower timber line
below which precipitation is insufficient to sustain a growth of
trees is about 7000 ft., and the upper timber line about 11,500 ft.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page546" id="page546"></a>546</span>
Oaks, juniper, piñon, cedars, yellow pine, fir and spruce grow
on the mountains and over large areas of the plateau country.<a name="fa2j" id="fa2j" href="#ft2j"><span class="sp">2</span></a>
The Coconino forest is one of the largest unbroken pine forests
(about 6000 sq. m.) in the United States. Since 1898 about
86% of the wooded lands have been made reservations, and work
has been done also to preserve the forest areas in the mountains
in the south-east, from which there are few streams of permanent
flow to the enclosing arid valleys.</p>

<p><i>Soil.</i>&mdash;The soils in the southern part of Arizona are mainly
sandy loams, varying from light loam to heavy, close adobe; on
the plateaus is what is known as &ldquo;mesa&rdquo; soil; and along the
rivers are limited overflow plains of fine sediment&mdash;especially
along the Colorado and the river Verde. These soils are in
general rich, but deficient in nitrogen and somewhat in humus;
and in limited areas white alkaline salts are injuriously in excess.
Virgin soils are densely compact. By far the most useful crops
are leguminous green manures, especially alfalfa, which grows
four to seven cuttings in a year and as a soil flocculator and
nitrogen-storer has proved of the greatest value. The greatest
obstacle to agriculture is lack of water. Artesian wells are much
used in the south-east. For the reservation of the water-partings&mdash;in
the past considerably denuded by lumbermen and ranchmen&mdash;the
increase of the forest areas, and the creation of reservoirs
along the rivers, to control their erratic flow<a name="fa3j" id="fa3j" href="#ft3j"><span class="sp">3</span></a> and impound their
flood waste for purposes of irrigation, much has been done by the
national government. The irrigated areas are only little spots
along the permanent streams. In 1900 the farm area was only
2.7% of the total area of the state and only 0.31% was
actually improved (including Indian reservations, 0.35%; in
1906, 0.92% was cultivated); of the land actually under crops,
88.5% was irrigated. The improved acreage more than quintupled
from 1880 to 1900. The total irrigated area in 1900 was
185,000 acres and in 1902, 247,250 acres. The increase in land
values by irrigation from 1890 to 1900 is estimated at $3,500,000.
A reservoir was begun in 1904 just below the junction of the
Tonto and the Salt with capacity to store 1,330,000 acre-ft. for
irrigation, and develop also an electric power sufficient to pump
underground water for an additional 50,000 acres at the lowest
estimate<a name="fa4j" id="fa4j" href="#ft4j"><span class="sp">4</span></a> of lands lying too high for supply by gravity.
Another important undertaking begun about the same time was
the throwing of an East Indian weir dam (the only one in the
United States) across the Colorado near Yuma, and the confinement
of both sides of the lower Gila and Colorado with levees.</p>

<p><i>Agriculture.</i>&mdash;Strawberries and Sahara dates; alfalfa, wheat,
barley, corn and sorghum; oranges, lemons, wine grapes, limes,
olives, figs, dates, peanuts and sweet potatoes; yams and sugar
beets, show the range of agricultural products. The date palm
fruits well; figs grow luxuriantly, though requiring much irrigation;
almonds do well if protected from spring frosts; sea-island
cotton grows in the finest grades, but is not of commercial
importance. The country about Yuma is particularly suited to
subtropical fruits. Temperate fruits&mdash;peaches, pears, apples,
apricots and small fruits&mdash;do excellently; as do all important
vegetables. The fruit industry is becoming more and more
important. Farming is very intensive, and crop follows crop
in swift succession; in 1905 the yield of barley per acre, 44
bushels, was greater than in any other state or territory, as was
the farm price per bushel on the 1st of December, 81 cents;
the average yield per acre of hay was the highest in the Union in
1903, 3.46 tons, the general average being 1.54 tons, was fourth in
1904, 2.71 tons (Utah 3.54, Idaho 3.07, Nevada 3.04), the general
average being 1.52 tons, and was highest in 1905, 3.75 tons, the
general average for the country being 1.54 tons; and in the
same three years the average value per acre of hay was greater
in Arizona than in any other state of the Union, being $35.78 in
1903, $40.22 in 1904, and $46.39 in 1905, the general averages for
the country being $13.93, $13.23 and $13.11 respectively, for the
three years. Of the total farm acreage of the state 97.6% were
held in 1900 by the whites; and of these 80.2% owned in whole
or in part the land they cultivated.</p>

<p>Stock-raising is a leading industry, but it has probably
attained its full development. The over-stocking of the ranges
has caused much loss in the past, and the almost total eradication
of fine native grasses over extended areas. Of the neat cattle
(7,042,635) almost 98%, and of the sheep (861,761) almost 100%,
were in 1900 pastured wholly or in part upon the public domain.
The extension of national forest reserves and the regulations
enforced by the United States government for the preservation
of the ranges have put limits to the industry. In 1900 the value
of live-stock represented 15.7% of the capital invested in
agriculture; the value of animals sold or slaughtered for
food ($3,204,758) was half the total value of all farm products
($6,997,097). Ostrich farms have been successfully established
in the Salt river valley since 1893; in 1907 there were six farms
in the Salt river valley, on which there were about 1354 birds;
the most successful food for the ostrich is alfalfa.</p>

<p><i>Minerals.</i>&mdash;Mining is the leading industry of Arizona.
Contrary to venerable traditions there is no evidence that
mining was practised beyond the most inconsiderable extent
by aborigines, Spanish <i>conquistadores</i>, or Jesuits. In 1738 an
extraordinary deposit of silver nuggets, quickly exhausted
(1741), was discovered at Arizonac. At the end of the 18th
century the Mexicans considerably developed the mines in the
south-east. The second half of the 19th century witnessed several
great finds; first, of gold placers on the lower Gila and Colorado
(1858-1869); later, of lodes at Tombstone, which flourished from
1879-1886, then decayed, but in 1905 had again become the
centre of important mining interests; and still later the development
of copper mines at Jerome and around Bisbee. Several of
the Arizona copper mines are among the greatest of the world.
The Copper Queen at Bisbee from 1880-1902 produced
378,047,210 &#8468; of crude copper, which was practically the total
output of the territory till after 1900, when other valuable
mines were opened; the Globe, Morenci and Jerome districts are
secondary to Bisbee. Important mines of gold and silver,
considerable deposits of wolframite, valuable ores of molybdenum
and vanadium, and quarries of onyx marble, are also worked.
Low-grade coal deposits occur in the east central part of the
state and near the junction of the Gila and San Pedro rivers.
Some fine gems of peridot, garnet and turquoise have been found.
The mineral products of Arizona for 1907 were valued at
$56,753,650; of which $51,355,687 (more than that of any other state)
was the value of copper; $2,664,000, gold; and $1,916,000, silver.
In 1907 the legislature passed an elaborate act providing
for the taxation of mines, its principal clause being that the
basis of valuation for taxation in each year be one-fourth of the
output of the mines in question for the next preceding year.</p>

<p><i>Manufactures.</i>&mdash;The manufacturing industries are of relatively
slight importance, though considerable promise attends the
experiments with canaigre as a source of tannin. The Navaho
and Moqui Indians make woollen blankets and rugs and the
Pimas baskets. Onyx marbles of local source are polished at
Phoenix. The capital invested in manufacturing industries
increased from $9,517,573 in 1900 to $14,395,654 in 1905, or
51.3%, and the value of products from $20,438,987 in 1900 to
$28,083,192 in 1905, or 37.4%. Of the total product in 1905
the product of the principal industry, the smelting and refining
of copper ($22,761,981), represented 81.1%; it was 9.4% of all
the smelting and refining of copper done in the United States in
that year. The other manufactures were of much less importance,
the principal ones being cars and general shop construction,
including repairs by steam railway companies ($1,329,308),
lumber and timber products ($960,778), and flour and grist mill
products ($743,124).</p>

<p>Two transcontinental railway systems, the Southern Pacific
and Santa Fe, were built across Arizona in 1878-1883. They
are connected by one line, and a feeder runs S. into Sonora.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page547" id="page547"></a>547</span>
The railway mileage of Arizona on the 1st of January 1908
was 1935.35 m.</p>

<p><i>Population.</i>&mdash;The population of Arizona in 1880 was
40,440; in 1890, 59,620; in 1900, 122,931 (including 28,623
reservation Indians not counted before); in 1910, 204,354. The
native population is of the most diverse origin; the foreign
element is equally heterogeneous, but more than half (in 1900,
14,172 out of 24,283 foreign-born) are Mexicans, many of whom
are not permanent residents; after 1900, immigrants were largely
mine labourers, and included Slavonians and Italians. The
largest towns in 1900 were Tucson, Phoenix, which is the
capital, Prcscott (pop. 3559), Jerome (pop. 1890, 250; in 1900,
2861); Winslow (pop. 1890, 363; in 1900, 1305), Nogales (pop.
1900, 1761), and Bisbee. The last was an insignificant mining
camp in 1880, still unincorporated in 1900, but with an estimated
population of 6000 in 1904. It is crowded picturesquely into
several narrow confluent ravines. Railway connexion with El
Paso was established in 1902. Douglas is another growing camp.</p>

<p>Over thirty Indian tribes are represented in the Indian schools
of Arizona. The more important are the Hualapais or Apache-Yumas;
the Mohaves; the Yavapais or Apache-Mohaves; the
Yumas, whose lesser neighbours on the lower Colorado are the
most primitive Indians of the United States in habits; the
Maricopas; the Pimas and Papagoes, who figure much in
early Arizona history, and who are superior in intelligence,
adaptability, application and character; the Hopis or Moquis,
possessed of the same good qualities and notably temperate and
provident, famous for their prehistoric culture (Tusuyan); the
Navaho, and the kindred Apaches, perhaps the most relentless
and savage of Indian warriors. All the Indians of Arizona live
on reservations save the few non-tribal Indians taxed and treated
as active citizens. Even the Apaches after being whipped
by relentless war into temporary submission have been bound
by treaties which the gifts, vices and virtues of the reservation
system have tempted them to observe. The Pimas and Papagoes
were early converted by the Spaniards, and retain to-day a
smattering of Christianity plentifully alloyed with paganism.
Apaches, Pimas, Papagoes have been employed by the United
States on great irrigation works, and have proved industrious
and faithful labourers. In 1900 there were 1836 taxed Indians,
26,480 reservation Indians not taxed, and in addition many
friendly Papagoes unenumerated.</p>

<p>In 1906 the Indian population was estimated as being 14% of
the whole population of Arizona, and that they are singularly
law-abiding is argued from the fact that in the same year the Indians
furnished only 3% of the convicts in the territorial prison.</p>

<p><i>Government and Education.</i>&mdash;Arizona became a territory of
the first (or practically autonomous) class in 1863. Her organic
law thereafter until 1910 consisted of various sections of the
Revised Statutes of the United States. From the beginning she
had a territorial legislature. Congress retained ultimately direct
control of all government, administration being in the hands of
resident officials appointed by the president and Senate. Special
mention must be made of the secret police, the Arizona Rangers,
organized in 1901 to police the cattle ranges; they are &ldquo;fearless
men, trained in riding, roping, trailing and shooting,&rdquo; a force
whose <i>personnel</i> is not known to the general public. The
legislature repealed the law licensing public gambling in 1907;
enacted a law requiring the payment of $300 per annum as
licence fee by retail liquor dealers; and provided for juvenile
courts and probationary control of children. In 1907 the total
tax valuation of property was $77,705,251; the net debt of the
territory $1,022,972, and that of counties and towns $3,123,275.
The receipts of the territorial treasury for the year ending on
the 30th of June 1907 were $687,386, and the disbursements for
the same period were $601,568. A homestead provision (1901)
exempts from liability for debts (except mortgages or liens placed
before the homestead claim) any homestead belonging to the head
of a family, existing in one compact body and valued at not more
than $2500; such a homestead a married man may not sell,
lease or put a lien on without his wife&rsquo;s consent. Personal
property to the value of $500 is exempt from the same liability.
The public school system was established in 1871. A compulsory
attendance law applies to children between 6 and 14 years of age,
but it is not generally obeyed by the Mexican element of population.
In 1907 there was an enrolment of 24,962 out of 33,167
children of school age; there were six high schools&mdash;three new
in 1906; and the average number of school days was 128.4. In
the fiscal year ending June 1907, the total receipts for schools
were $697,762, and the expenditures were $701,102. Illiteracy
is high, amounting in 1900 to 23.1% of native males, above 21
years of age, and 30.5% of foreign males, principally because of
the large number of Indians, Chinese, Japanese and Mexicans
in the state. There are two normal schools at Tempe (1886)
and Flagstaff (1899), a university at Tucson with an agricultural
experiment station that has done much for the industries of
Arizona; there is a considerable number of Indian schools, the
largest of which are maintained by the national government,
and the funds of the university come largely from the same source.
The first juvenile reform school, called the Territorial Industrial
school, was opened in 1903 at Benson. The territorial prison,
formerly at Yuma, was abandoned for a modern building at
Florence, Pinal county; and a hospital for the insane is 3 m.
from Phoenix.</p>

<p><i>History.</i>&mdash;The history of the South-west is full of interest to the
archaeologist. A prehistoric culture widely distributed has left
abundant traces. Pueblo ruins are plentiful in the basins of the
Gila and Colorado rivers and their tributaries. Geographical
conditions and a hard struggle against nature fixed the character
of this &ldquo;aridian&rdquo; culture, and determined its migrations; the
onslaughts of nomad Indians determined the sedentary civilization
of the cliff dwellers. A co-operative social economy is
evidenced by the traces of great public works, such as canals
many miles in length. The pueblos of the Gila valley are held to
be older than those of the Colorado. Casa Grande, 15 m. S.E.
of a railway station of the same name on the Southern Pacific
railway, is the most remarkable of plain ruins in the South-west,
the only one of its type in the United States. It resembles the
Casa Grande ruin of Chihuahua, Mexico, with its walls of sun-dried
puddled clay, and its area of rooms, courts and plazas,
surrounded by a wall. It was already a ruin when discovered in
1694 by the Jesuit father Kino. John Russel Bartlett described
it in 1854, and in 1889 Congress voted that it be protected
as a government reservation; in 1892 it was set apart by the
government. Excavations were made there in 1906-1907 by Dr
J. Walter Fewkes. Migration was northward. The valleys of the
Salt river and its affluents, the Agua Fria, Verde and Tonto,
are strewn with aboriginal remains; but especially important
in migrations of culture was the Little Colorado. A very
considerable population must have lived once in this valley. It is
represented to-day by the still undeserted habitats of Zuñi
(in New Mexico) and Tusayan; the Moquis, after the Zuñis,
are in customs and traditions the best survival of the ancient
civilization.</p>

<p>Arizona north of the Gila, save for a very limited and intermittent
missionary effort and for scant exploring expeditions,
was practically unknown to the whites until well after the
beginning of American rule. The Santa Cruz valley, however,
has much older annals of a past that charms by its picturesque
contrasts with the present. Arizona history begins with the
arrival in Sonora in 1536 of Alvar Nuñez Cabeza de Vaca, who,
although he had not entered Arizona or New Mexico, had heard
of them, and by his stories incited the Spaniards to explore the
unknown north in hope of wealth. Marcos de Niza, a Franciscan
friar to whom the first reconnaissance was entrusted, was the
first Spaniard to enter the limits of Arizona. He crossed the
south-eastern corner to Zuñi in 1539, passing through the Santa
Cruz valley; and F.V. de Coronado (<i>q.v.</i>) was led by Fray
Marcos over the same route in 1540; while Hernando Alarcon
explored the Gulf of California and the lower Colorado river.
Members of Coronado&rsquo;s expedition explored the Moqui country
and reached the Grand Canyon, and after this a succession of
remarkable and heroic explorations followed through the century;
which however accomplished little for geography, further confusing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page548" id="page548"></a>548</span>
and embellishing rather than clearing up its mysteries. All this
has left traces in still living myths about the early history of
the South-west. Early in the 17th century considerable progress
had been made in Christianizing the Pimas, Papagoes and Moquis.
Following 1680 came a great Indian revolt in New Mexico and
Arizona, and thereafter the Moquis remained independent of
Spanish and Christian domination, although visited fitfully by
rival Jesuits and Franciscans. In 1732 (possibly in 1720)
regular Jesuit missions were founded at Bac (known as an Indian
rancheria since the 17th century) and at Guevavi. The region
south of the Gila had already been repeatedly explored. In the
second half of the century there was a presidio at Tubac (whose
name first appears 1752) and some half-dozen pueblos de visita,
including the Indian settlement of Tucson.</p>

<p>A few errors should be corrected and some credit given with
reference to this early period. The Inquisition never had any
jurisdiction whatever over the Indians; compulsory labour by
the Indians was never legalized except on the missions, and the
law was little violated; they were never compelled to work
mines; of mining by the Indians for precious metals there is no
evidence; nor by the Jesuits (expelled in 1767, after which their
missions and other properties were held by the Franciscans),
except to a small extent about the presidio of Tubac, although
they did some prospecting. Persistent traditions have greatly
exaggerated the former prosperity of the old South-west. The
Spaniards probably provoked some inter-tribal intercourse
among the Indians, and did something among some tribes for
agriculture. Their own farms and settlements, save in the
immediate vicinity of the presidio, were often plundered and
abandoned, and such settlement as there was was confined to the
Santa Cruz valley. From about 1790 to 1822 was a period of
peace with the Apaches and of comparative prosperity for church
and state. The fine Indian mission church at Bac, long abandoned
and neglected, dates from the last decade of the 18th century.
The establishment of a presidio at Tucson in 1776 marks its
beginning as a Spanish settlement.</p>

<p>The decay of the military power of the presidios during the
Mexican war of independence, the expulsion of loyal Spaniards&mdash;notably
friars&mdash;and the renewal of Apache wars, led to the
temporary abandonment of all settlements except Tubac and
Tucson. The church practically forsook the field about 1828.</p>

<p>American traders and explorers first penetrated Arizona in the
first quarter of the 19th century. As a result of the Mexican War,
New Mexico, which then included all Arizona north of the Gila,
was ceded to the United States. California gold discoveries drew
particular attention to the country south of the Gila, which was
wanted also for a transcontinental railway route. This strip,
known as the &ldquo;Gadsden Purchase&rdquo; (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Gadsden, James</a></span>), was
bought in 1854 by the United States, which took possession
in 1856. This portion was also added to New Mexico. The
Mexicans, pressed by the Apaches, had, in 1848, abandoned even
Tubac and Tamacácori, first a visita of Guevavi, and after 1784
a mission. The progress of American settlement was interrupted
by the Civil War, which caused the withdrawal of the troops and
was the occasion for the outbreak of prolonged Indian wars.</p>

<p>Meanwhile a convention at Tucson in 1856 sent a delegate to
Congress and petitioned for independent territorial government.
This movement and others that followed were ignored by
Congress owing to its division over the general slavery question,
and especially the belief of northern members that the control of
Arizona was an object of the pro-slavery party. A convention
held in April 1860 at Tucson undertook to &ldquo;ordain and establish,&rdquo;
of its own motion, a provisional constitution until Congress should
&ldquo;organize a territorial government.&rdquo; This provisional territory
constituted all New Mexico south of 34° 40&prime; N. Officials were
appointed and New Mexican legislation for the Arizona counties
ignored, but nothing further was done. In 1861 it was occupied
by a Texan force, declared for the Confederacy, and sent a
delegate (who was not admitted) to the Confederate congress.
That body in January 1862 passed a formal act organizing the
territory, including in it New Mexico, but in May 1862 the
Texans were driven out by a Union force from California. By
act of the 24th of February 1863 Congress organized Arizona
territory as the country west of 109° W. long. In December
an itinerant government sent out complete from Washington
crossed the Arizona line and effected a formal organization. The
territorial capital was first at Prescott (1863-1867), then at
Tucson (1867-1877), again at Prescott (1877-1889), and finally
at Phoenix (since 1889).</p>

<p>There have been boundary difficulties with every contiguous
state or territory. The early period of American rule was
extremely unsettled. The California gold discoveries and overland
travel directed many prospecting adventurers to Arizona.
For some years there was considerable sentiment favouring
filibustering in Sonora. The Indian wars, breeding a habit of
dependence on force, and the heterogeneous elements of cattle
thieves, Sonoran cowboys, mine labourers and adventurers led
to one of the worst periods of American border history. But
since about 1880 there is nothing to chronicle but a continued
growth in population and prosperity. Agitation for statehood
became prominent in territorial politics for some years. In
accordance with an act of Congress, approved on the 16th of
June 1906, the inhabitants of Arizona and New Mexico voted on
the 6th of November 1906 on the question of uniting the territories
into a single state to be called Arizona; the vote of New Mexico
was favourable to union and statehood, but these were defeated
by the vote of Arizona (16,265 against, and 3141 for statehood).
In June 1910 the President approved an enabling act providing for
the admission of Arizona and New Mexico as separate states.</p>

<p><span class="bold">ARK<a name="ar112" id="ar112"></a></span> (a word common to Teutonic languages, cf. Ger. <i>Arche</i>,
adapted from the Lat. <i>arca</i>, chest, cf. <i>arcere</i>, to shut up, enclose),
a chest, basket or box. The Hebrew word <i>tebah</i>, translated in the
A.V. by &ldquo;ark,&rdquo; is used in the Old Testament (1) of the box made
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page549" id="page549"></a>549</span>
of bulrushes in which Pharaoh&rsquo;s daughter found the infant Moses
(Exodus ii. 3), and (2) of the great vessel or ship in which Noah
took refuge during the flood (Genesis vi.-ix.).</p>

<p><i>Noah&rsquo;s Ark.</i>&mdash;According to the story in Genesis, Noah&rsquo;s ark
was large enough to contain his family and representatives of each
kind of animal. Its dimensions are given as 300 cubits long,
50 cubits broad and 30 cubits high (cubit = 18-22 in.). It was
made of &ldquo;gopher&rdquo; wood, which has been variously identified
with cypress, pine and cedar. Before the days of the &ldquo;higher
criticism&rdquo; and the rise of the modern scientific views as to the
origin of species, there was much discussion among the learned,
and many ingenious and curious theories were advanced, as to
the number of the animals and the space necessary for their
reception, with elaborate calculations as to the subdivisions of the
ark and the quantities of food, &amp;c., required to be stored. It may
be interesting to recall the account given in the first edition of the
<i>Encyclopaedia Britannica</i> (1771), which contained a summary of
some of these various views (substantially repeated up to the
publication of the eighth edition, 1853). &ldquo;Some have thought the
dimensions of the ark as given by Moses too scanty ... and
hence an argument has been drawn against the authority of the
relation. To solve this difficulty many of the ancient Fathers and
the modern critics have been put to miserable shifts. But Buteo
and Kircher have proved geometrically that, taking the cubit of
a foot and a half, the ark was abundantly sufficient for all the
animals supposed to be lodged in it. Snellius computes the ark
to have been above half an acre in area ... and Dr Arbuthnot
computes it to have been 81,062 tuns ... if we come to a calculation
the number of species of animals will be found much less
than is generally imagined, not amounting to a hundred species
of quadrupeds, nor to two hundred of birds.... Zoologists
usually reckon but an hundred and seventy species in all.&rdquo; The
progress of the &ldquo;higher criticism,&rdquo; and the gradual surrender of
attempts to square scientific facts with a literal interpretation of
the Bible, are indicated in the shorter account given in the eighth
edition, which concludes as follows:&mdash;&ldquo;the insuperable difficulties
connected with the belief that all the existing species of
animals were provided for in the ark, are obviated by adopting
the suggestion of Bishop Stillingfleet, approved by Matthew
Poole, Pye Smith, le Clerc, Rossenmüller and others, that the
deluge did not extend beyond the region of the earth then
inhabited, and that only the animals of that region were preserved
in the ark.&rdquo; The first edition also gives an engraving of the
ark (repeated in the editions up to the fifth), in shape like a long
roofed box, floating on the waters; the animals are seen in
separate stalls. By the time of the ninth edition (1875) precise
details are no longer considered worthy of inclusion; and the age
of scientific comparative mythology has been reached.</p>

<p>The <i>Ark of the Law</i>, in the Jewish synagogue, is a chest or
cupboard containing the scrolls of the Torah (Pentateuch), and
is placed against or in the wall in the direction of Jerusalem. It
forms one of the most decorative features of the synagogue, and
often takes an architectural design, with columns, arches and a

<p><i>Ark of the Covenant, Ark of the Revelation, Ark of the Testimony</i>,
are the full names of the sacred chest of acacia wood overlaid
with gold which the Israelites took with them on their journey into
Palestine. The Biblical narratives reveal traces of a considerable
development in the traditions regarding this sacred object, and
those which furnish the most complete detail are of post-exilic
date when the original ark had been lost. The fuller titles of the
ark originate in the belief that it contained the &ldquo;covenant&rdquo;
(b&#277;r&#299;th) or &ldquo;testimony&rdquo; (&lsquo;&#275;d&#363;th), the technical terms for the
Decalogue (<i>q.v.</i>); primarily, however, it would seem to have been
called &ldquo;the ark of Yahweh&rdquo; (or &ldquo;Elohim&rdquo;), or simply &ldquo;the
ark.&rdquo; The word itself (&#257;r&#333;n) designates an ordinary chest (cp.
Gen. i. 26; 2 Kings xii. 10), and the (late) description of its
appearance represents it as an oblong box 2½ cubits long, 1½ cubits in
breadth and height (roughly 1.2 by .75 metres). It was lined
within and without with gold, and through four golden rings were
placed staves of acacia wood, by means of which it was carried.
A slab of the same metal (the so-called &ldquo;mercy-seat,&rdquo; <i>kapp&#333;reth</i>,
Gr. <i>hilast&#275;rion</i>) covered the top, and this was surmounted by two
Cherubim (Ex. xxv. 10-22, xxxvii. 1-9). The latter, however,
are not mentioned in earlier passages (Deut. x. 1, 3), and would
naturally increase the weight of the ark, which, according to
2 Sam. xv. 29, could be carried by two men.</p>

<p>The ark was borne by the Levites (Deut. x. 8), and the latest
narratives amplify the statement with a wealth of detail characteristic
of the post-exilic interest in this order. (See <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Levites</a></span>.)
An interesting passage relating the commencement of an Israelite
journey vividly illustrates the power of the sacred object. As the
ark started, it was hailed with the cry,&rdquo;Arise, Yahweh, let thine
enemies be scattered, let them that hate thee flee from before
thee,&rdquo; and when it came to rest, the cry again rang out,&rdquo;Return,
O Yahweh, to the myriads of families of Israel&rdquo; (Num. x. 33-36).
This saying appears to imply a settled life in Canaan, but both
affirm the warlike significance of Yahweh and the ark. Thus it is
the permanent pledge of Yahweh&rsquo;s gracious presence; it guides
the people on their journey and leads them to victory. It is no
mere receptacle, but a sacrosanct object as much to be feared as
Yahweh himself. To presume to fight without it was to invite
defeat, and on one notable occasion the Israelites attempted to
attack their enemy north of Kadesh without its aid, and were
defeated (Num. xiv. 44 sq.). There are many gaps in its history,
and although at the crossing of the Jordan and at the fall of
Jericho the ark figures prominently (Josh. iii. sq., vi. sq.), it
is unaccountably missing in stories of greater national moment.
Once it is found at Bethel (Judges xx. 27 sq.). It is met with
again at Shiloh, where it is under the care of Eli and his sons,
descendants of an ancient family of priests (1 Sam. ii. 28; cp.
Josh. xviii. 1). After a great defeat of Israel by the Philistines
it was brought into the field, but was captured by the enemy.
The trophy was set up in the Philistine temple of Ashdod, but vindicated
its superiority by overthrowing the god Dagon. A plague
smote the city, and when it was removed to Ekron, pestilence
followed in its wake. After taking counsel the Philistines placed
the ark with a votive offering upon a new cart drawn by two cows.
The beasts went of their own accord to Beth-shemesh, where it
remained in the field of a certain Joshua. Again a disaster
happened through some obscure cause, and seventy of the sons of
Jeconiah were smitten (1 Sam. vi. 19, R.V., margin). Thence it
was removed to the house of Abinadab of Kirjath-jearim, who
consecrated his son to its service (1 Sam. iv.-vii. 1). For many
years the ark remained untouched&mdash;apparently forgotten. Shiloh
disappears from history; neither Saul nor even Samuel, whose
youth had been spent with it, takes any further thought of it.
After a remarkable period of obscurity, the ark enters suddenly
into the history of David (2 Sam. vi.). Some time after the
capture of Jerusalem the ark was brought from Baal-Judah,
but at the threshing-floor of Nacon (an unintelligible name)
Abinadab&rsquo;s son Uzzah laid hands upon it and was struck down
for his impiety. On this account the place is said to have
received the name Perez-Uzzah (&ldquo;breach of Uzzah&rdquo;). It was
taken into the house of Obed-edom the Gittite (<i>i.e.</i> of Gath), and
brought a blessing upon his house during the three months that it
remained there. Finally the king had it conveyed to the city
of David, where a tent was prepared to shelter it. Once at
Jerusalem, it seems to have lost its unique value as the token of
Yahweh&rsquo;s presence; its importance was apparently merged with
that of the Temple which Solomon built. The foundation of the
capital would pave the way for the belief that the national god
had taken a permanent dwelling-place in the royal seat. The
prophets themselves lay no weight upon the ark as the central
point of Jerusalem&rsquo;s holiness. The real Deuteronomic code does
not mention it, and to Jeremiah (iii. 16) it was a thing of no
consequence. Later, in the age of the priestly schools, the ark received
much attention, although it must obviously be very doubtful how
far a true recollection of its history has survived. But nowhere
is any light thrown upon its fate. The invasion of Shishak, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page550" id="page550"></a>550</span>
capture of Jerusalem by Joash (2 Kings xiv. 13, 14), the troublous
reign of Manasseh, the destruction of Jerusalem by Nebuchadrezzar,
have found each its supporters. The wild legends of
its preservation at the taking of Jerusalem (2 Macc. ii. and
elsewhere) only show that the popular mind was unable to share the
view that the ark was an obsolete relic. More poetical is the
tradition that the ark was raised to heaven, there to remain
till the coming of the Messiah, a thought which embodies the
spiritual idea that a heavenly pledge of God&rsquo;s covenant and
faithfulness had superseded the earthly symbol.<a name="fa1k" id="fa1k" href="#ft1k"><span class="sp">1</span></a></p>

<p>A critical examination of the history of the Israelite ark
renders it far from certain that the object was originally the
peculiar possession of all Israel. Many different traditions have
gathered around the story of the Exodus, and the ark was not the
only divinely sent guide or forerunner which led the Israelites.
Its presence at Shiloh, and its prominence in the life of Joshua,
support the view that it was the palladium of the Joseph tribes,
but the traditions in question conflict with others. The account
of the commencement of the ark&rsquo;s journey associates it with
Moses and his kin (Num. x. 29 sqq.)&mdash;that is, with the south
Palestinian clans with which the term &ldquo;Levites&rdquo; appears to be
closely connected. (See <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Levites</a></span>.) A distinct movement direct
into Judah is implied by certain old traditions (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Caleb</a></span>), but
this is subordinated to the more comprehensive account of the
journey round by the east of the Jordan. (See <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Exodus, The</a></span>.)
The narratives in 1 Sam. iv.-vi. stand on a plane by themselves,
and the gap between them and 2 Sam. vi. has not been satisfactorily
fixed. But it is not certain that the two belong to the
same cycle of tradition; Kirjath-jearim and Baal-Judah are
identified only in later writings, and the behaviour of Saul&rsquo;s
daughter (2 Sam. vi. 15 sqq.) may conceivably imply that the ark
was an unknown object to Benjamites. It is of course possible
that the ark was originally the sacred shrine of the clans which
came direct to Judah, and that the traditions in 1 Sam. iv.-vi.,
Josh. iii. sqq. are of secondary origin, and are to be associated with
its appearance at Shiloh, the fall of which place, although attributed
to the time of Samuel, is apparently regarded by Jeremiah
(xxvi. 6) as a recent event. Of these two divergent traditions, it
would seem that the one which associates it with the kin of Moses
and David may be traced farther in those late narratives which
connect the ark closely with the Levites and even attribute its
workmanship to Bezalel, a Calebite (Ex. xxxi. 2; 1 Chron.
ii. 19 sqq.). The tradition in Psalms cxxxii. 6 of the search for the
ark at Jaar (Kirjath-jearim) and Ephratah is not clear; but a
comparison with 1 Chron. ii. 50 seems to show that it recognized
the &ldquo;Calebite&rdquo; origin of the ark.</p>

85 sqq. (Giessen, 1908).</p>

<p>Whether the ark originally contained some symbol of Yahweh
or not has been the subject of much discussion. Thus, it has been
held that it contained stone fetishes (meteoric stones and the
like) from Yahweh&rsquo;s original abode on Sinai or Horeb. As the
palladium of the Joseph tribes, it has even been suggested that
the bones of Joseph were treasured in the ark. Others have
regarded it as an empty portable throne,<a name="fa2k" id="fa2k" href="#ft2k"><span class="sp">2</span></a> or as a receptacle for
sacred serpents (analogies in Frazer, <i>Pausanias</i>, iv. pp. 292, 344).
That it contained the tables of the law (Deut. x. 2; 1 Kings viii. 9)
was the later Israelite view, and the subsequent development is
illustrated in Heb. ix. 4. It is enough to decide that the ark
represented in some way or other the presence of Yahweh and
that the safety of his followers depended upon its security
(analogies in Frazer, <i>Paus.</i> x. p. 283). The Semitic world affords
many examples of the belief that a man&rsquo;s religion was part of his
political connexion and that the change of nationality involved
change of cult. He who leaves his land to enter another, leaves his
god and is influenced by the religion of his new home (1 Sam.
xxvi. 19; Ruth i. 16 sqq.), but strangers know not &ldquo;the cult of the
God of the land&rdquo; (2 Kings xvii. 26). No nation willingly changes
its god (Jer. ii. 11), and there are means whereby the follower of
Yahweh may continue his worship even when outside Yahweh&rsquo;s
land (2 Kings v. 17). When a people migrate they may take
with them their god, and if they conceive him to be a spiritual
being who cannot be represented by an image, they may desire a
symbolical expression of or, rather, a substitute for his presence.
Accordingly the conception of the ark must be based in the first
instance upon the beliefs of the particular clans or tribes whose
sacred object it was.</p>

<p><span class="bold">ARKANSAS,<a name="ar113" id="ar113"></a></span> a river of the United States of America, rising
in the mountains of central Colorado, near Leadville, in lat.
39° 20&prime; N., long. 106° 15&prime; W., and emptying into the Mississippi,
at Napoleon, Arkansas, in lat. 33° 40&prime; N. Its total length is
about 2000 m., and its drainage basin (greater than that of the
Upper Mississippi) about 185,000 sq. m. It is the greatest
western affluent of the Missouri-Mississippi system. It rises in a
pocket of lofty peaks at an altitude of 10,400 ft. on a sharply
sloping plateau, down which it courses as a mountain torrent,
dropping 4625 ft. in 120 m. At Canyon City it passes out of the
Rockies through the Grand Canyon of the Arkansas; then turning
eastward, and soon a turbid, shallow stream, depositing its
mountain detritus, it flows with steadily lessening gradient and
velocity in a broad, meandering bed across the prairies and lowlands
of eastern Colorado, Kansas, Oklahoma and Arkansas,
shifting its direction sharply to the south-east in central Kansas.
The Arkansas ordinarily receives little water from its tributaries
save in time of floods. In topography and characteristics and in
the difficulties of its regulation the Arkansas is in many ways
typical of the rivers in the arid regions of the western states.
The gradient below the mountains averages 7.5 ft. per mile
between Canyon City and Wichita, Kansas (543 m.), about 1.5 ft.
between Wichita and Little Rock (659 m.), and 0.65 of a foot from
Little Rock to the mouth (173 m.). The shores are sand, clay or
loam throughout some 1300 m., with very rare rock ridges or
rapids, and the banks rise low above ordinary water. The waters
are constantly rising and falling, and almost never is the discharge
at any point uniform. Every year there are, normally, two
distinct periods of high water; one an early freshet due mainly
to the heavy winter rainfall on the lower river, when the upper
river is still frozen hard; the other in the late spring, due to
the setting in of rains along the upper courses also, and to the
melting of the snow in the mountains. The lowest waters are
from August to December. In the summer there are sometimes
violent floods due to cloud-bursts. Everywhere along the river
there is a never-ending variation of velocity and discharge, and
an equally ceaseless transformation of the river&rsquo;s bed and
contour. These changes become revolutionary in times of flood.
All these characteristics are accentuated below Little Rock. The
depth of water at this point has been known to vary from 27 ft.
to only half-a-foot, and the discharge to fall to 1170 cub. ft. per
second. There is often no more than 1.5 ft. of water, and far below
Little Rock a depth of 3 ft. on crossings is not infrequent. In
many places there are different channels for high and low water,
the latter being partly filled by each freshet, and recut after
each subsidence; and the river meanders tortuously through the
alluvial bottom in scores of great bends, loops and cut-offs. It is
estimated that the eating and caving of the shore below Little
Rock averages 7.64 acres per mile every year (as against 1.99
acres above Little Rock). By way of the White river cut-off the
Arkansas finds an additional outlet through the valley of that
river in times of high water, and the White, when the current
in its natural channel is deadened by the backwaters of the
Mississippi, finds an outlet by the same cut-off through the valley
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page551" id="page551"></a>551</span>
of the Arkansas. This backwater, where it meets and checks the
current of the Arkansas, occasions the precipitation of enormous
alluvial deposits, and vast quantities of snags. The banks are
disintegrated along this part of the river and built up again on
the opposite side to their original height in the extraordinarily
short time of two or three years, the channel remaining all the
while narrow. At the mouth of the White, the Arkansas and
the Mississippi the level of recurrent floods is 6 or 8 ft. above
the timber-bearing soil along the banks, and all along the lower
river the country is liable to overflow; and as the land backward
from the stream slopes downward from the banks heaped
up by successive flood-deposits, each overflow creates along the
river a fringe of swamps. These features, although exaggerated
in the portion of the river now in question, are qualitatively
characteristic of its entire course below the mountains.</p>

<p>Up to the 30th of June 1907 the government of the United
States expended $2,384,557 on improvements along the Arkansas.
Almost half of this sum was required for snagging operations
alone. There is a considerable traffic on the river within the
borders of Arkansas in miscellaneous freights, and a slight
passenger movement. The river is rarely navigable above Fort
Smith, and during a considerable part of the year not above Pine
Bluff. Steamer service is maintained the year round between
this point and Memphis. Ordinarily there are some 400 m. of
channel open to steamers part of the year, and in time of high
flood considerably more. To the mouth of the Grand river
(460 m.) the river is open about four months in a year for
vessels of 4 ft. draft and about eight months for vessels of 2 ft.
draft.</p>

<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">ARKANSAS,<a name="ar114" id="ar114"></a></span> one of the South Central states of the United
States of America, situated between 89° 40&prime; N. and 94° 42&prime; W.,
bounded N. by Missouri, E. by the Mississippi river, separating
it from Tennessee and Mississippi, and W. by Texas and Oklahoma.
Its area is 53,335 sq. m., of which 810 are water surface.</p>

<p>Arkansas lies in the drainage basin of the lower Mississippi, and
has a remarkable river system. The Arkansas bisects the state
from W. to E.; along its valley lie the oldest and largest
settlements of the state. Nine other considerable streams drain the
state; of these, the Red, the Ouachita, the White and the St
Francis are the most important. There are a number of swamps
and bayous in the eastern part.</p>

<p><i>Physical Features.</i>&mdash;The surface of Arkansas is the most
diversified of that of any state in the central Mississippi valley.
It rises, sloping upward toward the N.W., from an average
elevation of less than 300 ft. in the south-east to heights of
2000 ft. and more in the north-western quarter. There are four
physiographic regions: two of highlands; one of river valley
plain separating the two highland areas; while the fourth is a
region of hills, lowlands and scanty prairie. The last covers the
E. half of the state, and is part of the Gulf or coastal plain
province of the United States. If a line be drawn from the
point where the Red river cuts the western boundary to where
the Black cuts the northern, E. of it is the Gulf plain and W.
of it are the highlands (over 500 ft.) and the mineral regions
of the state. They are divided by the valley of the Arkansas
river into two regions, which are also structurally different.
South of the river are the Ouachita Mountains, and north of it
are the Boston Mountains. The Ouachita Mountains are
characterized by close folding and faulting. Their southern edge
is covered with cretaceous deposits, and their eastern edge is
covered as well with the tertiary deposits of the Gulf plains. The
Arkansas valley is marked by wide and open folding. The Boston
Mountains are substantially a continuation of the Ozark dome of
Missouri. Their northern border is marked by an escarpment of
500 to 700 ft. in height. The trend is from E. to W. between
Batesville and Wagoner, Oklahoma. In structure they are
monoclinical, their rocks&mdash;sandstones and shales&mdash;being laid
southward and blending on that side with the Arkansas valley
region. The entire region is very much dissected by streams,
and the topography is characteristically of a terrace and
escarpment type. In the highlands N. of the Arkansas the country
is very irregularly broken; S. of the river the hills lie less
capriciously in short, high ranges, with low, fertile valleys
between them. The Ouachitas extend 200 m., from within
Oklahoma (near Atoka) to central Arkansas, near Little Rock.
They are characterized by long, low ridges bearing generally
W.-E., with wide, flat valleys. Near the western boundary
of the state they attain a maximum altitude of 2900 ft. above the
sea, and 2000 ft. above the valleys of the Arkansas and Red
river; falling in elevation eastward (as westward) to 500-700 ft.
at their eastern end. Five peaks rise above 2000 ft. Magazine
Mountain, 2833 ft. above the sea-level and 2350 ft. above
the surrounding country, is the highest point between the
Alleghanies and the Rockies. Altitudes of 2250 ft. are attained
in the Boston Mountains, which are the highest portion of the
Ozark uplift, and the most picturesque. The streams are vigorous,
and in their lower courses flow in deep-cut gorges, 500 to
1000 ft. deep, almost deserving the name of canyons. The main
streams are tortuous, and their dendritic tributaries have cut the
region into ridges. The mountains do not fill the N.W. quarter
of the state, and are separated from a lower, greatly eroded
highland region on their N. by a bold escarpment 500 to 1000
ft. in height. Along the upper course of the White river in the
Bostons and in the country about Hot Springs in the Ouachitas
is found the most beautiful scenery of the highlands; few regions
are more beautiful. The valley region embraces the bottom-lands
along the Mississippi, and up the Arkansas as far as Pine Bluff,
and the cypress swamp country of the St Francis.</p>

<p><i>Climate.</i>&mdash;The climate of the state is &ldquo;southern,&rdquo; owing to the
influence of the Gulf of Mexico. The mean temperatures for the
different seasons are normally about 41.6°, 61.1°, 78.8° and
61.9° F. for winter, spring, summer and autumn respectively.
The normal mean precipitations are about 11.7, 14.5, 10.5 and
10.2 in. for the same seasons. The extreme range of the monthly
isotherms crossing the state is from about 35° in winter to 81° F.
in summer, and the range of annual isotherms from about 54° to
60° F. That is, the variation of mean annual temperatures for
different parts of the state is only 6° F. The variation of the
mean annual temperature for the entire state is only 4° (from
59° to 63° F.). The variation of precipitation is as great as 30 in.
(from 34 to 64 in.) according to locality. There is little snow, no
severe winter cold, and no summer drought. Sheltered valleys
in the interior produce spring crops three or four weeks earlier
than is usual in Kansas. The climate is generally healthy.</p>

<p><i>Flora.</i>&mdash;Arkansas lies in the humid, or Austroriparian, area of
the Lower Austral life-zone, except the highlands of the Ozark
uplift and Ouachita Mountains, which belong to the humid,
or Carolinian, area of the Upper Austral. The state possesses a
rich fauna and flora. From an economic standpoint its forests
deserve special mention. The forest lands of the state include
four-fifths of its area, and three-fourths are actually covered by
standing timber. Valuable trees are of great variety: cottonwood,
poplar, catalpa, red cedar, sweet-gum, birch-eye, sassafras,
persimmon, ash, elm, sycamore, maple, a variety of pines, pecan,
locust, dogwood, hickory, various oaks, beech, walnut and
cypress are all abundant. There are one hundred and twenty-nine
native species of trees. The yellow pine, the white oak
and the cypress are the most valuable growths. The northern
woods are mainly hard; the yellow pine is most characteristic
of the heavy woods of the south central counties; and magnificent
cypress abounds in the north-east. Hard woods grow even
on the alluvial lands. &ldquo;The hard-wood forests of the state are
hardly surpassed in variety and richness, and contain inestimable
bodies of the finest oak, walnut, hickory and ash timber&rdquo; (U.S.
Census, 1870 and 1900). The growth on the alluvial bottoms
and the lower uplands in the E. is extraordinarily vigorous.
The leading species of the Appalachian woodland maintain their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page552" id="page552"></a>552</span>
full vigour of growth nearer to the margin of forest growth in
this part of the Mississippi valley than in any other part of the
United States; and some species, such as the holly, the osage
orange and the pecan, attain their fullest growth in Arkansas
(Shaler). There are two Federal forest reserves (4968 sq. m.).</p>

<p><i>Soil.</i>&mdash;The soils of Arkansas are of peculiar variety. That of
the highlands is mostly but a thin covering, and their larger
portion is relatively poorly fitted for agriculture. The uplands
are generally fertile. Their poor soils are distinctively sandy,
those of the lowlands clayey; but these elements are usually
found combined in rich loams characterized by the predominance
of one or the other constituent. Finally the alluvial bottoms are
of wonderful richness.</p>

<p><i>Agriculture.</i>&mdash;This variety of soils, a considerable range of
moderate altitudes and favourable factors of heat and moisture
promote a rich diversity in agriculture. Arkansas is predominantly
an agricultural state. The farm area of 1860 was only
28.2% of the whole area of the state, that of 1900 (16,636,719
acres) was 49%; and while only a fifth of this farm area was
actually improved in 1860, two-fifths were improved in 1900;
thus, the part of the state&rsquo;s area actually cultivated
approximately quadrupled in four decades. The value of products in
1900 ($79.6 millions) was 44% of the total farm values ($181.4
millions). The rise in average value of farm lands since 1870 has
not been a fifth of the increase of the aggregate value of all farm
property.</p>

<p>The Civil War wrought a havoc from which a full recovery was
hardly reached before 1890. The economic evolution of the state
since Reconstruction has been in the main that common to all
the old slave states developing from the plantation system of
ante-bellum days, somewhat diversified and complicated by the
special features of a young and border community. The farms
of Arkansas increased in number 357.8%, in area 73.7% and in
total true (as distinguished from tax) valuation about 53.8%
between 1860 and 1900; the decade of most extraordinary
growth being that of 1870-1880. Thus Arkansas has shared that
fall in the average size of farms common to all sections of the
Union (save the north central) since 1850, but especially marked
since the Civil War in the &ldquo;Cotton States,&rdquo; owing to the subdivision
of large holdings with the introduction of the tenant
system. The rapidity of the movement has not been exceptional
in Arkansas, but the size of its average farm, less in 1850
than that of the other cotton states, was in 1900, 93.1 acres
(108.8 for white farmers alone, 49.0 for blacks alone), which was
even less than that of the North Atlantic states (96.5 acres, the
smallest sectional unit of the Union). The percentage of farms
worked by owners fell from 69.1% in 1880 to 54.6% in 1900;
the difference of the balances or 14.5% indicates the increase of
tenant holdings, two-thirds of these being for shares.</p>

<p>It is interesting to compare in this matter the whites and the
negroes. In actual numbers the white farmers heavily predominate,
whether as owners, tenants for cash or tenants on shares;
but if we look at the numbers within each race holding by these
respective tenures (65.0, 8.7 and 26.3% respectively for whites;
25.6, 33.7 and 40.7% for negroes, in 1900), we see the lesser
independence of the negro farmer. The cotton counties, which
are the counties of densest coloured habitancy, exemplify this
fact with great clearness. The few negroes in the white counties
of the uplands are much better off than those in the cotton lowlands;
more than three times as large a part of them owners;
the poorer element is segregated in the cotton region. In
Arkansas, as elsewhere in the south, negro tenants, like white
tenants, are more efficient than owners working their own lands.
The black farmer is in bondage to cotton; for him still &ldquo;Cotton
is King.&rdquo; He gives it four-fifths of his land; while his white
rival allows it only a quarter of his, less by half than the area he
gives to live-stock, dairying, hay and grains. At Sunnyside, on the
west bank of the Mississippi, negro tenant farmers have been
practically forced out of business by Italians, who produced in
1899-1904 more than twice as much lint cotton per working
hand, and 70% more per acre. The general place of the negro
in agriculture is shown also by the fact that more than four-fifths
of the farm acreage and farm values of the state are in the hands
of the whites. The white farmer gives an outlay in labour and
fertilizers on his farm greater by 61.4% than the black, gathers
a produce greater by 22.5%, and possesses a farm of a value
53.5% greater (Census, 1900).</p>

<p>Cotton is the leading product. It absorbs about a third of the area
under crops, and its returns ($28,000,000 in 1899) are about a half
of the value of all crops. A part of the cotton lands of Arkansas
are among the richest in the south. Other distinctively southern
products (tobacco, &amp;c.) are of no importance in Arkansas.
Cereals are given more than twice as much acreage as cotton,
but yield only a third as great aggregate returns, Indian corn
being much the most remunerative; about three-fourths of the
cereal acreage are given to its cultivation, and it ranks after
cotton in value of harvest.<a name="fa1l" id="fa1l" href="#ft1l"><span class="sp">1</span></a> For all the other staple agricultural
products of the central states the showing of Arkansas is uniformly
good, but not noteworthy. But its rank as a fruitgrowing
country is exceptional. Plums, prunes, peaches, pears
and grapes are cultivated very generally over the western half of
the state (grapes in the east also), but with greatest success in
the south-west; apples prosper best in the north-west. Small
berries are a very important product. All fruits are of the finest
quality. For apples the state makes probably a finer showing
than that of any other state except Oregon. About ninety
varieties are habitually entered in national competitions. The
fruit industry generally has developed with extreme rapidity.</p>

<p><i>Manufactures.</i>&mdash;Although Arkansas is rich in minerals and in
forests, in 1900 only 2% of its population were engaged in
manufacturing. But the development has been rapid; the value of
products multiplied seven times, the wages paid nine, and the
capital invested twelve, in the years 1880-1900; and the
increase in the same categories from 1900-1905 was 35, 42.8 and
82.4% respectively.<a name="fa2l" id="fa2l" href="#ft2l"><span class="sp">2</span></a> It must be noted as characteristic of the
state that of the total manufactures in 1905, 80.3% were produced
in rural districts (83.7 in 1900). About two-thirds of the
increase between 1890 and 1900 was in the lumber industry
which was of slight importance before the former year; it represented
more than half the total value of the manufactures of the
state in 1905 (output, 1905, $28,065,171 and of mill products
$3,786,772 additional); in the value of lumber and timber
products the state ranked sixth among the states of the United
States in 1900, and seventh in 1905. After the lumber and
timber industry ranked in 1905 the manufacture of cotton-seed
oil and cake ($4,939,919) and flour and grist milling. Cotton
ginning increased 739% from 1890 to 1900.</p>

<p class="pt2"><i>Minerals.</i>&mdash;The progress of coal-mining has been a striking
feature of the state&rsquo;s economy since 1880. The field extends
from Oklahoma eastward to central Arkansas, along both sides
of the Arkansas river. A production of 5000 tons (short) in
1882 became 542,000 tons in 1891 and 2,229,172 tons in 1903&mdash;a
maximum for the state up to 1905; in 1907 the yield was
2,670,438 tons, valued at $4,473,693; the value of the product
increased more than eight-fold in 1886-1900. The United States
Geological Survey estimates that three-fourths of the coal area
(over 1700 sq. m.) can made commercially productive. Apart
from coal the great and varied mineral wealth of the state has
been only slightly utilized. The great zinc and lead area along
the northern border in the plateau portion of the Ozark region
has proved a disappointment in development; the iron areas
have hardly been touched, and the product of the exceptionally
promising deposits of manganese lost ground after 1890 before
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page553" id="page553"></a>553</span>
the output of Virginia and Georgia. Among the products of
the rich stone quarries of the state, only that of abrasive stones
is important in the markets of the Union; the novaculites of
Arkansas are among the finest whetstones in the world. Deposits
of true chalk are utilized in the manufacture of Portland cement
for local markets. The chalk region lies in the S.E. part of the
state, S. of the Ouachita Mountains. Bauxite was discovered
in the state in 1887, and the product increased from 5045
long tons in 1899 to 50,267 long tons in 1906, the production for
the whole country in 1899 being 35,280 long tons and in 1906
75,332 long tons. The only other states in which bauxite was
produced during the period were Alabama and Georgia, which
in this respect have greatly declined in importance relatively
to Arkansas. Extremely valuable and varied marls, kaolins and
clays, fuller&rsquo;s earth, asphaltum and mineral waters show special
promise in the state&rsquo;s industry. In 1906 diamonds were found in
a peridotite dike in Pike county 2½ m. S.E. of Murfreesboro;
this is the first place in North America where diamonds have
been found <i>in situ</i>, and not in glacial deposit or in river gravel.</p>

<p><i>Communications.</i>&mdash;The rivers afford for light craft (of not over
3 ft. draft) about 3000 m. of navigable waters, a river system
unequalled in extent by that of any other state. The labours of
the United States government have much extended and very
greatly improved this navigation, materially lessening also the
frequency and havoc of floods along the rich bottom-lands
through which the rivers plough a tortuous way in the eastern
and southern portions of the state. As a result of these improvements
land and timber values have markedly risen, and great
impetus has been given to traffic on the rivers, which carry a
large part of the cotton, lumber, coal, stone, hay and
miscellaneous freights of the state. The greatest of these internal
improvements is the St Francis levee, from New Madrid,
Missouri, to the mouth of the St Francis, 212 m. along the
Mississippi; an area of 3500 sq. m., of exceptional fertility, is
here reclaimed at a cost of about $1500 per sq. m. (as compared
with $10,000 per sq. m. for the 2500 sq. m. reclaimed by the Nile
works at Assuan and Assiut). Whether with regard to area or
population, Arkansas is also relatively well supplied with railways
(4,472.8 m. at the end of 1907). A state railway commission
controls transportation rates, which are also somewhat checked
by the competition of river freights. There is also a considerable
passenger traffic on the Arkansas.</p>

<p><i>Population.</i>&mdash;The population in 1910 was 1,574,449. The
growth in 1880-1900 is shown by the following table:&mdash;</p>

<p>In 1900 the rank of the state in total population was twenty-fifth,
and in negro population tenth. The proportion of the coloured
element steadily rose from 11% in 1820 to 28% in 1900, at which
time there were more than a dozen counties along the border of the
Mississippi and lower Arkansas in which the negroes numbered
50 to 89% of the total. They have never been a large element in
the highland counties; it was these counties which were most
strongly Unionist at the time of the Civil War, and which to-day
are the region of diversified industry. About a ninth of the
state&rsquo;s population is gathered into towns of more than 2000
inhabitants. Fort Smith (pop. 11,587 in 1900), Little Rock,
the state capital (38,307), and Pine Bluff (11,496) lie in the valley
of the Arkansas. In 1900 a dozen other towns had a population
exceeding 2500, the most important being Hot Springs (9973),
Helena (5550), Texarkana (4914), Jonesboro (4508), Fayetteville
(4061), Eureka Springs (3572), Mena (3423) and Paragould
(3324). Foreign blood has only very slightly permeated the
state; negroes and native whites of native parents make up
more than 95% of its population. Immigration is almost
entirely from other southern states. The strongest religious
sects are the Methodists and Baptists.</p>

<p><i>Government.</i>&mdash;The present constitution of the state dates from
1874 (with amendments). Few features mark it off from the
usual type of such documents. The governor holds office for two
years; he has the pardoning and veto power, but his veto may
be overridden by a simple majority in each house of the whole
number elected to that house (a provision unusual among the
state constitutions of the Union). There is no lieutenant-governor.
The legislature is bicameral, senators holding office
for four years, representatives (about thrice as numerous) for
two. The length of the regular biennial legislative sessions is
limited to sixty days, but by a vote of two-thirds of the members
elected to each house the length of any session may be extended.
Special sessions may be called by the governor. A majority of
the members elected to each of the two houses suffices to propose
a constitutional amendment, which the people may then accept
by a mere majority of all votes cast at an election for the
legislature (an unusually democratic provision); no more than three
amendments, however, can be proposed or submitted at the same
time. The supreme court has five members, elected by the
people for eight years; they are re-eligible. The population of
the state entitles it to seven representatives in the national
House of Representatives, and to nine votes in the Electoral
College (census of 1900). Elections of members of the state
legislature and of Congress are not held at the same time&mdash;a very
unusual provision. Elections are by Australian ballot; the
constitution prescribes that no law shall &ldquo;be enacted whereby
the right to vote at any election shall be made to depend upon any
previous registration of the elector&rsquo;s name&rdquo; (extremely unusual).
The qualifications for suffrage include one year&rsquo;s residence in the
state, six months in the county, and one month in the voting
district, next before election; idiots, insane persons, convicts,
Indians not taxed, minors and women are disqualified; aliens
who have declared their intention to become citizens of the
United States vote on the same terms as actual citizens. An
amendment of 1893 requires the exhibition of a poll-tax receipt
by every voter (except those &ldquo;who make satisfactory proof that
they have attained the age of twenty-one years since the time of
assessing taxes next preceding&rdquo; the election). There is nothing
in the constitution or laws of Arkansas with any apparent
tendency to disfranchise the negroes; there are statutory
provisions (1866-1867) against intermarriage of the races and
constitutional and statutory (1886-1887) provisions for separate
schools, a &ldquo;Jim Crow&rdquo; law (1891) requires railways to provide
separate cars for negroes, and a law (1893) provides for separate
railway waiting-rooms for negroes. Giving or accepting a
challenge to a duel bars from office, but this survival of the
ante-bellum social life is to-day only reminiscent. Declared
atheists are similarly disqualified. There is no constitutional
provision for a census. Marriage is pronounced a civil contract.
A law for compulsory education was passed in 1909.</p>

<p><i>Finance.</i>&mdash;The constitution makes 1% on the assessed valuation
of property a maximum limit of state taxation for ordinary
expenses, but by an amendment of 1906 the legislature may levy
three mills on the dollar per annum for common schools; and
may &ldquo;authorize school districts to levy by a vote of the qualified
electors of such district a tax not to exceed seven mills on the
dollar in any year for school purposes.&rdquo; The state debt in 1874
was $12,108,247, of which about $9,370,000 was incurred after the
Civil War for internal improvement schemes. This new debt was
practically repudiated in 1875 by a decision of the supreme court,
and completely set aside in 1884 by constitutional amendment.
Until 1900, when an adjustment of the matter was reached, there
was also another disputed debt to the national government,
owing to the collapse in 1839 of a so-called Real Estate Bank of
Arkansas, in which the state had invested more than $500,000
paid to it by the United States in exchange for Arkansas bonds
to be held as an investment for the Smithsonian Institution,
on which bonds the state defaulted after 1839. If the
unacknowledged debt be included (as it often is; and hence the
necessity of reference to it), very few states&mdash;and those all
western or southern&mdash;have a heavier burden per capita. But
the acknowledged debt was in 1907 only $1,250,500, and this is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page554" id="page554"></a>554</span>
not a true debt, being a permanent school fund that is not to be
paid off; of this total in 3% bonds, $1,134,500 is held by the
common schools and $116,000 by the state university. In net
combined state and local debt, Arkansas ranks very low among
the states of the Union. The hired labourer suffers from the
&ldquo;truck&rdquo; system, taking his pay in board and living, in goods, in
trade on his employer&rsquo;s credit at the village store; the independent
farmer suffers in his turn from unlimited credit at the
same store, where he secures everything on the credit of his future
crops; and if he is reduced to borrow money, he secures it by
vesting the title to his property temporarily in his creditor.
His legal protections under such &ldquo;title bonds&rdquo; are much
slighter than under mortgages. Homesteads belonging to the
head of a family and containing 80 to 160 acres (according to
value) if in the country, or a lot of ¼ to one acre (according to
value), if in town, village or city, are exempt from liability for
debts, excepting liens for purchase money, improvements or
taxes. A married man may not sell or mortgage a homestead
without his wife&rsquo;s consent.</p>

<p><i>Education</i>.&mdash;The legal beginnings of a public school system date
from 1843; in 1867 the first tax was imposed for its support.
Only white children were regarded by the laws before Reconstruction
days. There are now separate race schools, with terms of
equal length, and offering like facilities; the number of white
and coloured teachers employed is approximately in the same
proportion to the number of attending children of the respective
races; in negro districts two out of three school directors are
usually negroes. &ldquo;The coloured race as a whole go to the
schools as regularly and as numerously in proportion as do the
whites&rdquo; (Shinn). Of the current expenses of the common schools
about three-fourths is borne by the localities; the state distributes
its contribution annually among the counties. There is also
a permanent school fund derived wholly from land grants from
the national government. The total expenditure for the schools
is creditable to the state; but before 1909 hardly half the school
population attended; and in general the rural conditions
of the state, the shortness of the school terms and the dependence
of the schools primarily upon local funds and local supervision,
make the schools of inadequate and quite varying excellence.
The average expenditure in 1906 for tuition per child enrolled
was $4.93, and the average length of the school term was only
eighty-one days. In June 1906 there were 1102 school houses in
the state valued at $100 or less. In 1905-1906 the Peabody Board
gave $2000 to aid rural schools, and in general it has done much
for the improvement of country public schools throughout the
state. In 1906 an amendment to the state constitution, greatly
increasing the tax resources available for educational work, was
passed by a large popular vote. The University of Arkansas was
opened at Fayetteville in 1872. The law and medical faculties are
at Little Rock. A branch normal school, established 1873-1875
at Pine Bluff, provides for coloured students, who enjoy the same
opportunities for work, and are accorded the same degrees, as the
students at Fayetteville; they are about a fourth as numerous.
In 1905-1906 there were 497 students in the college of liberal
arts, sciences and engineering, 548 in the preparatory school
and 26 in the conservatory of music and arts, all in Fayetteville;
171 in the medical school and 46 in the law school in Little
Rock; and 240 in the branch normal college at Pine Bluff. The
university and the normal school are supported by the Morrill
Fund and by state appropriations. The state still suffered in
1906 from the lack of a separate and special training school for
teachers; but in 1907 the legislature voted to establish a state
normal school. Of the Morrill Fund (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Morrill, Justin
Smith</a></span>), three-elevenths goes to the normal school. The
agricultural experiment station of the university dates from
1887. The financial support of the university has been light,
about three-fifths coming from the United States government.
Besides the university there are about a score of denominational
colleges or academies, of which half-a-dozen are for coloured
students. Among the large denominational colleges are
Philander Smith College, Little Rock (Methodist Episcopal,
1877); Ouachita College, Arkadelphia (Baptist, 1886); Hendrix
College, Conway (Methodist Episcopal, South, 1884); and
Arkansas College, Batesville (Presbyterian, 1872). There are few
libraries in Arkansas. In this matter her showing has long been
among the very poorest in the Union relatively to her population.
Daily papers are few in number. The state charitable institutions&mdash;insane
asylum, deaf-mute and blind institutes&mdash;and
the penitentiary, are at Little Rock.</p>

<p>Local government is of the ordinary southern county type,
without noteworthy variations. Municipal corporations rest
upon a general state law, not upon individual charters. The
liquor question is left by the state to county (<i>i.e.</i> including
&ldquo;local,&rdquo; or town) option, and prohibition is the most common
county law, the alternative being high-licence.</p>

<p><i>History</i>.&mdash;The first settlement by Europeans in Arkansas was
made in 1686 by the French at Arkansas Post (later the residence
of the French and Spanish governors, important as a trading post
in the earlier days of the American occupation, and the first
territorial capital, 1819-1820). In 1720 a grant on the Arkansas
was made to John Law. In 1762 the territory passed to Spain,
in 1780 back to France, and in 1803 to the United States as a
part of the &ldquo;Louisiana Purchase.&rdquo; Save in the beginnings of
western frontier trade, and in a great mass of litigation left to the
courts of later years by the curious and uncertain methods of land
delimitation that prevailed among the French and Spanish colonists,
the pre-American period of occupation has slight connexions
with the later period, and scant historical importance.</p>

<p>From 1804 to 1812 what is now Arkansas was part of the
district (and then the territory) of Louisiana, and from 1812 to
1819 of the territory of Missouri. Its earliest county organizations
date from this time. It was erected successively into a
territory of the first and second class by acts of Congress of the
2nd of March 1819 and the 21st of April 1820. By act of the
15th of June 1836 it was admitted into the Union as a slave
state.</p>

<p>There is little of general interest in the history of ante-bellum
days. Economic life centred in the slave plantation, and there
was remarkable development up to the Civil War. The decade
1819-1829 saw the first newspaper (1819), the beginning of steamboating
on Arkansas rivers, and the first weekly mail from the
east. Trade was largely confined to the rivers and freighting for
Sante Fé and Salt Lake before the war, but the first railway
entered the state in 1853. Social life was sluggish in some ways
and wild in others. An unhappy propensity to duelling, the
origin in Arkansas of the bowie-knife,&mdash;from an alleged use of
which Arkansas received the nickname, which it has always
retained, of the &ldquo;toothpick state,&rdquo;&mdash;and other backwoods
associations gave the state a reputation which to some extent has
survived in spite of many years of sober history. The questions
of the conduct of territorial affairs do not seem to have been
contested systematically on national party lines until about 1825.
The government of Arkansas before the Civil War was always in
the hands of a few families closely intermarried. From the
beginning the state has been unswervingly Democratic, save in
the Reconstruction years, though often with heavy Whig or
Republican minorities.</p>

<p>In February 1861 the people of Arkansas voted to hold a
convention to consider the state of public affairs. The convention
assembled on the 4th of March. Secession resolutions were
defeated, and it was voted to submit to the people the question
whether there should be &ldquo;co-operation&rdquo; through the Lincoln
government, or &ldquo;secession.&rdquo; The plan was endorsed of holding
a convention of all the states to settle the slavery question, and
delegates were chosen to the proposed Border State Convention
that was to meet at Frankfort, Kentucky, on the 27th of May.
Then came the fall of Fort Sumter and the proclamation of
President Lincoln calling for troops to put down rebellion. The
governor of Arkansas curtly refused its quota. A quick surge of
ill-feeling, all the bitterer on account of the divided sentiments
of the people, chilled loyalty to the Union. The convention reassembled
on call of the governor, and on the 6th of May, with a
single dissentient voice, passed an ordinance of secession. It
then repealed its former vote submitting the question of secession
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page555" id="page555"></a>555</span>
to the people. On the 16th of May Arkansas became one of the
Confederate States of America.</p>

<p>In the years of war that followed, a very large proportion
of the able-bodied men of the state served in the armies of the
Confederacy; several regiments, some of coloured troops, served
the Union. Union sentiment was strongest in the north. In
1862-1863 various victories threw more than half the state,
mainly the north and east, under the Federal arms. Accordingly,
under a proclamation of the president, citizens within the
conquered districts were authorized to renew allegiance to the
Union, and a special election was ordered for March 1864, to
reorganize the state government. But meanwhile, a convention
of delegates chosen mainly at polls opened at the army posts,
assembled in January 1864, abolished slavery, repudiated
secession and the secession war debt, and revised in minor details
the constitution of 1836, restricting the suffrage to whites. This
new fundamental law was promptly adopted by the people, <i>i.e.</i>
by its friends, who alone voted. But the representatives of
Arkansas under this constitution were never admitted to Congress.</p>

<p>The Federal and Confederate forces controlled at this time
different parts of the state; there was some ebb and flow of
military fortune in 1864, and for a short time two rival governments.
Chaotic conditions followed the war. The fifteenth
legislature (April 1864 to April 1865) ratified the Thirteenth
Amendment, and passed laws against &ldquo;bush-whacking,&rdquo; a term
used in the Civil War for guerilla warfare, especially as carried
on by pretended neutrals. Local militia, protecting none who
refused to join in the common defence, and all serving &ldquo;not as
soldiers but as farmers mutually pledged to protect each other
from the depredations of outlaws who infest the state,&rdquo; strove
to secure such public order as was necessary to the gathering of
crops, so as &ldquo;to prevent the starvation of the citizens&rdquo; (governor&rsquo;s
circular, 1865). Struggling in these difficulties, the government of
the state was upset by the first Reconstruction Act. The governor
in these years (1865-1868) was a Republican, the caster of the
single Union vote in the convention of 1861; but the sixteenth
legislature (1866-1867) was largely Democratic. It undertook
to determine the rights of persons of African descent, and regrettable
conflicts followed. The first Reconstruction Act having
declared that &ldquo;no legal state government or adequate protection
for life or property&rdquo; existed in the &ldquo;rebel states,&rdquo; Arkansas was
included in one of the military districts established by Congress.
A registration of voters, predominantly whites, was at once
carried through, and delegates were chosen for another constitutional
convention, which met at Little Rock in January 1868.
The secessionist element was voluntarily or perforce excluded.
This convention ratified the Fourteenth Amendment, and framed
the third constitution of the state, which was adopted by a small
majority at a popular election, marred by various irregularities,
in March 1868. By its provisions negroes secured full political
rights, and all whites who had been excluded from registration for
the election of delegates to the convention were now practically
stripped of political privileges. The organization of Arkansas
being now acceptable to Congress, a bill admitting it to the Union
was passed over President Johnson&rsquo;s veto, and on the 22nd of
June 1868 the admission was consummated.</p>

<p>Arkansas now became for several years Republican, and
suffered considerably from the rule of the &ldquo;carpet-baggers.&rdquo;
The debt of the state was increased about $9,375,000 from 1868 to
1874, largely for railroad and levee schemes; much of the money
was misappropriated, and in a case involving the payment of
railway aid bonds the action of the legislature in pledging the
credit of the state was held nugatory by the state supreme court
in 1875 on the ground that, contrary to the constitution, the bond
issue had never been referred to popular vote. An amendment
to the constitution approved by a popular vote in 1884 provided
that the General Assembly should &ldquo;have no power to levy any
tax, or make any appropriation, to pay&rdquo; any of the bonds issued
by legislative action in 1868, 1869 and 1871. The current expenses
of the state in the years of Reconstruction were also enormously
increased. The climax of the Reconstruction period was the so-called
Baxter-Brooks war.</p>

<p>Elisha Baxter (1827-1899) was the regular Republican candidate
for governor in 1872. He was opposed by a disaffected
Republican faction known as &ldquo;brindletails,&rdquo; or as they called
themselves, &ldquo;reformers,&rdquo; led by Joseph Brooks (1821-1877), and
supported by the Democrats. Baxter was irregularly elected.
The election was contested, and his choice was confirmed by
the legislature, the court of last resort in such cases. He soon
showed a willingness to rule as a non-partisan, and favoured
the re-enfranchisement of white citizens. This would have
put the Democrats again in power, and they rallied to Baxter,
while the Brooks party now assumed the name of &ldquo;regulars,&rdquo; and
received the support of the &ldquo;carpet-bag&rdquo; and negro elements.
After Baxter had been a year in office Brooks received a
judgment of <i>ouster</i> against him from a state circuit judge, and
got possession of the public buildings (April 1874). The state
flew to arms. The legislature called for Federal intervention
(May 1874), and Federal troops maintained neutrality while
investigations were conducted by a committee sent out by
Congress. As a result, President Grant pronounced for Baxter,
and the Brooks forces disbanded.</p>

<p>The chief result was another convention. In 1873 the article
of the constitution which had disfranchised the whites was
repealed, and the Democrats thus regained power. By an overwhelming
majority the people now voted for another convention,
which (July to October 1874) framed the present constitution.
It removed all disfranchisement, and embraced equitable amnesty
and exemption features. It also took away all patronage from
the governor, reduced his term to two years, forbade him to
proclaim martial law or suspend the writ of <i>habeas corpus</i>, and
abolished all registration laws: all these provisions being reflections
of Reconstruction struggles. The people ratified the new
constitution on the 13th of October 1874. After Reconstruction
the state again became Democratic, and the main interest
of its history has been the progress of economic development.</p>

<p><span class="bold">ARKANSAS CITY,<a name="ar115" id="ar115"></a></span> a city of Cowley county, Kansas, U.S.A.,
situated near the S. boundary of the state, in the fork of the
Arkansas and Walnut rivers. Pop. (1890) 8347; (1900) 6140,
of whom 302 were negroes; (1905) 7634; (1910) 7508. The city
is served by the Atchison, Topeka &amp; Santa Fé, the Missouri
Pacific, the St Louis &amp; San Francisco, the Midland Valley and
the Kansas South-Western railways. To the south is the Chilocco
Indian school (in Key county, Oklahoma), established by the U.S.
government in 1884. A canal joining the Arkansas and Walnut
rivers furnishes good water power. The manufactories include flour
mills, packing establishments, a creamery and a paint factory.
The city is situated in the midst of a rich agricultural region and
is a supply centre for southern Kansas and Oklahoma, with large
jobbing interests. The municipality owns and operates the waterworks.
Arkansas City, first known as Creswell, was settled in
1870, was chartered as a city under its present name in 1872
and was rechartered in 1880.</p>

<p><span class="bold">ARKLOW,<a name="ar116" id="ar116"></a></span> a seaport and market town of Co. Wicklow, Ireland,
in the east parliamentary division, 49 m. S. of Dublin, by the
Dublin &amp; South-Eastern railway. Pop. (1901) 4944. Sea-fisheries
are prosecuted, and there are oyster-beds on the coast,
but the produce requires to be freed from a peculiar flavour by the
purer waters of the Welsh and English coast before it is fit for
food. The produce of the copper and lead mines of the Vale of
Avoca is shipped from the port. There are cordite and explosives
works, established by Messrs Kynoch of Birmingham, England.
In 1882 an act was passed providing for the improvement of
the harbour and for the appointment of harbour commissioners.
The town hall and the Protestant church (1899) were gifts of the
earl of Carysfort, in whose property the town is situated. There
are slight ruins of an ancient castle of the Ormondes, demolished in
1649 by Cromwell. On the 9th of June 1798 the Irish insurgents,
attacking the town, were defeated by the royal troops near Arklow
Bridge, and their leader, Father Michael Murphy, was killed.</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">ARKWRIGHT, SIR RICHARD<a name="ar117" id="ar117"></a></span> (1732-1792), English inventor,
was born at Preston in Lancashire, on the 23rd of December 1732,
of parents in humble circumstances. He was the youngest of
thirteen children, and received but a very indifferent education.
After serving his apprenticeship in his native town, he established
himself as a barber at Bolton about 1750, and later amassed a
little property from dealing in human hair and dyeing it by a
process of his own. This business he gave up about 1767 in order
to devote himself to the construction of the spinning frame. The
spinning jenny, which was patented by James Hargreaves
(d. 1778), a carpenter of Blackburn, Lancashire, in 1770, though
he had invented it some years earlier, gave the means of spinning
twenty or thirty threads at once with no more labour than had
previously been required to spin a single thread. The thread
spun by the jenny could not, however, be used except as weft,
being destitute of the firmness or hardness required in the
longitudinal threads or warp. Arkwright supplied this deficiency
by the invention of the spinning-frame, which spins a vast number
of threads of any degree of fineness and hardness.</p>

<p>The precise date of the invention is not known; but in 1767 he
employed John Kay, a watchmaker at Warrington, to assist him
in the preparation of the parts of his machine, and he took out a
patent for it in 1769. The first model was set up in the parlour
of the house belonging to the free grammar school at Preston.
This invention having been brought to a fairly advanced stage,
he removed to Nottingham in 1768, accompanied by Kay and
John Smalley of Preston, and there erected his first spinning
mill, which was worked by horses. But his operations were at
first greatly fettered by want of capital, until Jedediah Strutt
(<i>q.v.</i>), having satisfied himself of the value of the machines, entered
with his partner, Samuel Need, into partnership with him, and
enabled him in 1771 to build a second factory, on a much larger
scale, at Cromford in Derbyshire, the machinery of which was
turned by a water-wheel. A fresh patent, taken out in 1775,
covered several additional improvements in the processes of
carding, roving and spinning. As the value of his processes
became known, he began to be troubled with infringements of his
patents, and in 1781 he took action in the courts to vindicate his
rights. In the first case, against Colonel Mordaunt, who was
supported by a combination of manufacturers, the decision was
unfavourable to him, on the sole ground that the description of
the machinery in the specification was obscure and indistinct. In
consequence he prepared a &ldquo;case,&rdquo; which he at one time intended
to lay before parliament, as the foundation of an application for
an act for relief. But this intention was subsequently abandoned;
and in a new trial (<i>Arkwright</i> v. <i>Nightingale</i>) in February 1785,
the presiding judge having expressed himself favourably with
respect to the sufficiency of the specification, a verdict was given
for Arkwright. On this, as on the former trial, nothing was
stated against the originality of the invention.</p>

<p>In consequence of these conflicting verdicts, the whole matter
was brought, by a writ of <i>scire facias</i>, before the court of King&rsquo;s
Bench, to have the validity of the patent finally settled, and it
was not till this third trial, which took place in June 1785, that
Arkwright&rsquo;s claim to the inventions which formed the subject
of the patent was disputed. To support this new allegation,
Arkwright&rsquo;s opponents brought forward, for the first time,
Thomas Highs, or Hayes, a reed-maker at Bolton, who stated
that he had invented a machine for spinning by rollers previously
to 1768, and that he had employed the watchmaker Kay to make
a model of that machine. Kay himself was produced to prove
that he had communicated that model to Arkwright, and that
this was the real source of all his pretended inventions. Having
no idea that any attempt was to be made to overturn the patent
on this new ground, Arkwright&rsquo;s counsel were not prepared with
evidence to repel this statement, and the verdict went against
him. On a motion for a new trial on the 10th of November of
the same year it was stated that he was furnished with affidavits
contradicting the evidence that had been given by Kay and
others with respect to the originality of the invention; but the
court refused to grant a new trial, on the ground that, whatever
might be the fact as to the question of originality, the
deficiency in the specification was enough to sustain the verdict,
and the cancellation of the patents was ordered a few days
afterwards. His fortunes, however, were not thereby seriously
affected, for by this time his business capacity and organizing
skill had enabled him to consolidate his position, in spite of the
difficulties he had encountered not only from rival manufacturers
but also from the working classes, who in 1779 displayed their
antipathy to labour-saving appliances by destroying a large mill
he had erected near Chorley.</p>

<p>Though a man of great personal strength, Arkwright never
enjoyed good health, and throughout his career of invention and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page557" id="page557"></a>557</span>
discovery he laboured under a severe asthmatic affection. A
complication of disorders at length terminated his life on the 3rd
of August 1792, at his works at Cromford. He was knighted in
1786 when he presented a congratulatory address from the
wapentake of Wirksworth to George III., on his escape from the
attempt on his life by Margaret Nicholson.</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">ARLES,<a name="ar118" id="ar118"></a></span> a town of south-eastern France, capital of an
arrondissement in the department of Bouches-du-Rhône, 54 m. N.W.
of Marseilles by rail. Pop. (1906) 16,191. A canal unites Arles
with the harbour of Bouc on the Mediterranean. Arles stands on
the left bank of the Rhone, just below the point at which the river
divides to form its delta. A tubular bridge unites it with the
suburb of Trinquetaille on the opposite bank. The town is
hemmed in on the east by the railway line from Lyons to
Marseilles, on the south by the Canal de Craponne. Its streets
are narrow and irregular, and, away from the promenades which
border it on the south, there is little animation. In the centre
of the town stand the Place de la République, a spacious square
overlooked by the hôtel de ville, the museum, and the old
cathedral of St Trophime, the finest Romanesque church in
Provence. Founded in the 7th century, St Trophime has been
several times rebuilt, and was restored in 1870. Its chief portal,
which dates from the 12th century, is a masterpiece of graceful
arrangement and rich carving. The interior, plain in itself,
contains interesting sculpture. The choir opens into a beautiful
cloister, the massive vaulting of which is supported on heavy
piers adorned with statuary, between which intervene slender
columns arranged in pairs and surmounted by delicately carved
capitals. Two of the galleries are Romanesque, while two
are Gothic. Arles has two other churches of the Romanesque
period, and others of later date. The hôtel de ville, a building
of the 17th century, contains the library. Its clock tower,
surmounted by a statue of Mars, dates from the previous century.
The museum, occupying an old Gothic church, is particularly
rich in Roman remains and in early Christian sarcophagi; there
is also a museum of Provençal curiosities. The tribunal of
commerce and the communal college are the chief public institutions.
Arles is not a busy town and its port is of little importance.
There are, however, flour mills, oil and soap works, and the
Paris-Lyon-Méditerranée Railway Company have large workshops.
Sheep-breeding is a considerable industry in the vicinity.
The women of Arles have long enjoyed a reputation for marked
beauty, but the distinctive type is fast disappearing owing to their
intermarriage with strangers who have immigrated to the town.</p>

<p>Arles still possesses many monuments of Roman architecture
and art, the most remarkable being the ruins of an amphitheatre
(the <i>Arénes</i>), capable of containing 25,000 spectators, which, in
the 11th and 12th centuries, was flanked with massive towers,
of which three are still standing. There are also a theatre, in
which, besides the famous Venus of Arles, discovered in 1651,
many other remains have been found; an ancient obelisk of
a single block, 47 ft. high, standing since 1676 in the Place de
la République; the ruins of the palace of Constantine, the
forum, the thermae and the remains of the Roman ramparts
and of aqueducts. There is, besides, a Roman cemetery known
as the Aliscamps (<i>Elysii Campi</i>), consisting of a short avenue
once bordered by tombs, of which a few still remain.</p>

<p>The ancient town, <i>Arelate</i>, was an important place at the
time of the invasion of Julius Caesar, who made it a settlement
for his veterans. It was pillaged in <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 270, but restored and
embellished by Constantine, who made it his principal residence,
and founded what is now the suburb of Trinquetaille. Under
Honorius, it became the seat of the prefecture of the Gauls and
one of the foremost cities in the western empire. Its bishopric
founded by St Trophimus in the 1st century, was in the
5th century the primatial see of Gaul; it was suppressed in
1790. After the fall of the Roman empire the city passed into
the power of the Visigoths, and rapidly declined. It was
plundered in 730 by the Saracens, but in the 10th century became
the capital of the kingdom of Arles (see below). In the 12th
century it was a free city, governed by a <i>podesta</i> and <i>consuls</i>
after the model of the Italian republics, which it also emulated in
commerce and navigation. In 1251 it submitted to Charles I.
of Anjou, and from that time onwards followed the fortunes of
Provence. A number of ecclesiastical synods have been held at
Arles, as in 314 (see below), 354, 452 and 475.</p>

<p><i>Synod of Arles (314).</i>&mdash;As negotiations held at Rome in October
313 had failed to settle the dispute between the Catholics and the
Donatists, the emperor Constantine summoned the first general
council of his western half of the empire to meet at Arles by the
1st of August following. The attempt of Seeck to date the synod
316 presupposes that the emperor was present in person, which is
highly improbable. Thirty-three bishops are included in the most
authentic list of signatures, among them three from Britain,&mdash;York,
London and &ldquo;Colonia Londinensium&rdquo; (probably a corruption
of Lindensium, or Lincoln, rather than of Legionensium or
Caerleon-On-Usk). The twenty-two canons deal chiefly with the
discipline of clergy and people. Husbands of adulterous wives are
advised not to remarry during the lifetime of the guilty party.
Reiteration of baptism in the name of the Trinity is forbidden.
For the consecration of a bishop at least three bishops are
required. It is noteworthy that British representatives assented
to Canon I., providing that Easter be everywhere celebrated
on the same day: the later divergence between Rome and the
Celtic church is due to improvements in the <i>supputatio Romana</i>
adopted at Rome in 343 and subsequently.</p>

<p><span class="bold">ARLES,<a name="ar119" id="ar119"></a></span> <span class="sc">Kingdom of</span>, the name given to the kingdom formed
about 933 by the union of the old kingdoms of Provence (<i>q.v.</i>)
or Cisjurane Burgundy, and Burgundy (<i>q.v.</i>) Transjurane, and
bequeathed in 1032 by its last sovereign, Rudolph III., to the
emperor Conrad II. It comprised the countship of Burgundy
(<i>Franche-Comté</i>), part of which is now Switzerland (the dioceses
of Geneva, Lausanne, Sion and part of that of Basel), the
Lyonnais, and the whole of the territory bounded by the Alps,
the Mediterranean and the Rhone; on the right bank of the
Rhone it further included the Vivarais. It is only after the end
of the 12th century that the name &ldquo;kingdom of Arles&rdquo; is applied
to this district; formerly it was known generally as the kingdom
of Burgundy, but under the Empire the name of Burgundy came
to be limited more and more to the countship of Burgundy, and
the districts lying beyond the Jura. The authority of Rudolph
III. over the chief lords of the land, the count of Burgundy and
the count of Maurienne, founder of the house of Savoy, was
already merely nominal, and the Franconian emperors (1039-1125),
whose visits to the country were rare and of short duration,
did not establish their power any more firmly. During the first
fifty years of their domination they could rely on the support of
the ecclesiastical feudatories, who generally favoured their cause,
but the investiture struggle, in which the prelates of the kingdom
of Arles mostly sided with the pope, deprived the Germanic
sovereigns even of this support. The emperors, on the other
hand, realized early that their absence from the country was a
grave source of weakness; in 1043 Henry III. conferred on
Rudolph, count of Rheinfelden (afterwards duke of Swabia), the
title of <i>dux et rector Burgundiae</i>, giving him authority over the
barons of the northern part of the kingdom of Arles. Towards
the middle of the 12th century Lothair II. revived this system,
conferring the rectorate on Conrad of Zähringen, in whose family
it remained hereditary up to the death of the last representative
of the house, Berthold V., in 1218; and it was the lords of
Zähringen who were foremost in defending the cause of the
Empire against its chief adversaries, the counts of Burgundy.
In the time of the Swabian emperors, the Germanic sovereignty
in the kingdom of Arles was again, during almost the whole period,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page558" id="page558"></a>558</span>
merely nominal, and it was only in consequence of fortuitous
circumstances that certain of the heads of the Empire were able
to exercise a real authority in these parts. Frederick I., by his
marriage with Beatrix (1156), had become uncontested master
of the countship of Burgundy; Frederick II., who was more
powerful in Italy than his predecessors had been, and was extending
his activities into the countries of the Levant, found Provence
more accessible to his influence, thanks to the commercial
relations existing between the great cities of this country and
Italy and the East. Moreover, the heretics and enemies of the
church, who were numerous in the south, upheld the emperor in
his struggle against the pope. Henry VII. also, thanks to his
good relations with the princes of Savoy, succeeded in exercising
a certain influence over a part of the kingdom of Arles. The
emperors further tried to make their power more effective by
delegating it, first to a viceroy, William of Baux, prince of
Orange (1215), then to an imperial vicar, William of Montferrat
(1220), who was succeeded by Henry of Revello and William of
Manupello. In spite of this, the history of the kingdom of Arles
in the 13th century, and still more in the 14th, is distinguished
particularly by the decline of the imperial authority and the
progress of French influence in the country. In 1246 the
marriage of Charles, the brother of Saint Louis, with Beatrice,
the heiress to the countship of Provence, caused Provence to pass
into the hands of the house of Anjou, and many plans were made
to win the whole of the kingdom for a prince of this house. At
the beginning of the 14th century the bishops of Lyons and
Viviers recognized the suzerainty of the king of France, and in
1343 Humbert II., dauphin of Viennois, made a compact with
the French king Philip VI. that on his death his inheritance
should pass to a son or a grandson of the French king. Humbert,
who was perhaps the most powerful noble in Arles, was induced
to take this step as he had just lost his only son, and Philip had
already cast covetous eyes on his lands. Then in 1349, being in
want of money, he agreed to sell his possessions outright, and thus
Viennois, or Dauphiné, passed into the hands of Philip&rsquo;s grandson,
afterwards King Charles V. The emperor Charles IV. took
an active part in the affairs of the kingdom, but without any
consistent policy, and in 1378 he, in turn, ceded the imperial vicariate
of the kingdom to the dauphin, afterwards King Charles VI.
This date may be taken as marking the end of the history of the
kingdom of Arles, considered as an independent territorial area.</p>

<p><span class="bold">ARLINGTON, HENRY BENNET,<a name="ar120" id="ar120"></a></span> <span class="sc">Earl of</span> (1618-1685),
English statesman, son of Sir John Bennet of Dawley, Middlesex,
and of Dorothy Crofts, was baptized at Little Saxham, Suffolk,
in 1618, and was educated at Westminster school and Christ
Church, Oxford. He gained some distinction as a scholar and a
poet, and was originally destined for holy orders. In 1643 he
was secretary to Lord Digby at Oxford, and was employed as
a messenger between the queen and Ormonde in Ireland. Subsequently
he took up arms for the king, and received a wound in the
skirmish at Andover in 1644, the scar of which remained on his
face through life.<a name="fa1m" id="fa1m" href="#ft1m"><span class="sp">1</span></a> And after the defeat of the royal cause he
travelled in France and Italy, joined the exiled royal family in
1650, and in 1654 became official secretary to James on Charles&rsquo;s
recommendation, who had already been attracted by his
&ldquo;pleasant and agreeable humour.&rdquo;<a name="fa2m" id="fa2m" href="#ft2m"><span class="sp">2</span></a> In March 1657 he was
knighted, and the same year was sent as Charles&rsquo;s agent to Madrid,
where he remained, endeavouring to obtain assistance for the
royal cause, till after the Restoration. On his return to England
in 1661 he was made keeper of the privy purse, and became the
prime favourite. One of his duties was the procuring and
management of the royal mistresses, in which his success gained
him great credit. Allying himself with Lady Castlemaine, he
encouraged Charles&rsquo;s increasing dislike to Clarendon; and he
was made secretary of state in October 1662 in spite of the opposition
of Clarendon, who had to find him a seat in parliament. He
represented Callington from 1661 till 1665, but appears never
to have taken part in debate. He served subsequently on the
committees for explaining the Irish Act of Settlement and for
Tangiers. In 1663 he obtained a peerage as Baron Arlington of
Arlington, or Harlington, in Middlesex, and in 1667 was appointed
one of the postmasters-general. The control of foreign affairs was
entrusted to him, and he was chiefly responsible for the attack
on the Smyrna fleet and for the first Dutch War. In 1665 he
advised Charles to grant liberty of conscience, but this was merely
a concession to gain money during the war; and he showed great
activity later in oppressing the nonconformists. On the death of
Southampton, whose administration he had attacked, his great
ambition, the treasurership, was not satisfied; and on the fall of
Clarendon, against whom he had intrigued, he did not, though
becoming a member of the Cabal ministry, obtain the supreme
influence which he had expected; for Buckingham first shared,
and soon surpassed him, in the royal favour. With Buckingham
a sharp rivalry sprang up, and they only combined forces when
endeavouring to bring about some evil measure, such as the ruin
of the great Ormonde, who was an opponent of their policy and
their schemes. Another object of jealousy to Arlington was Sir
William Temple, who achieved a great popular success in 1668
by the conclusion of the Triple Alliance; Arlington endeavoured
to procure his removal to Madrid, and entered with alacrity into
Charles&rsquo;s plans for destroying the whole policy embodied in the
treaty, and for making terms with France. He refused a bribe
from Louis XIV., but allowed his wife to accept a gift of 10,000
crowns;<a name="fa3m" id="fa3m" href="#ft3m"><span class="sp">3</span></a> in 1670 he was the only minister besides the Roman
Catholic Clifford to whom the first secret treaty of Dover (May
1670), one clause of which provided for Charles&rsquo;s declaration of
his conversion to Romanism, was confided (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Charles II</a></span>.);
and he was the chief actor in the deception practised upon the rest
of the council.<a name="fa4m" id="fa4m" href="#ft4m"><span class="sp">4</span></a> He supported several other pernicious measures&mdash;the
scheme for rendering the king&rsquo;s power absolute by force of
arms; the &ldquo;stop of the exchequer,&rdquo; involving a repudiation of
the state debt in 1672; and the declaration of indulgence the
same year, &ldquo;that we might keep all quiet at home whilst we are
busy abroad.&rdquo;<a name="fa5m" id="fa5m" href="#ft5m"><span class="sp">5</span></a> On the 22nd of April 1672 he was created an
earl, and on the 13th of June obtained the Garter; the same
month he proceeded with Buckingham on a mission, first to
William at the Hague, and afterwards to Louis at Utrecht,
endeavouring to force upon the Dutch terms of peace which were
indignantly refused. But Arlington&rsquo;s support of the court policy
was entirely subordinate to personal interests; and after the
appointment of Clifford in November 1672 to the treasurership,
his jealousy and mortification, together with his alarm at the
violent opposition aroused in parliament, caused him to veer
over to the other side. He advised Charles in March 1673 to
submit the legality of the declaration of indulgence to the House
of Lords, and supported the Test Act of the same year, which
compelled Clifford to resign. He joined the Dutch party, and in
order to make his peace with his new allies, disclosed the secret
treaty of Dover to the staunch Protestants Ormonde and
Shaftesbury.<a name="fa6m" id="fa6m" href="#ft6m"><span class="sp">6</span></a> Arlington had, however, lost the confidence of all
parties, and these efforts to procure support met with little
success. On the 15th of January 1674 he was impeached by the
Commons, the specific charges being &ldquo;popery,&rdquo; corruption and
the betrayal of his trust&mdash;Buckingham in his own defence having
accused him the day before of being the chief instigator of the
French and anti-Protestant policy, of the scheme of governing by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page559" id="page559"></a>559</span>
the army, of responsibility for the Dutch War, and of
embezzlement. But the motion for his removal, owing chiefly to the
influence of his brother-in-law, the popular Lord Ossory, was
rejected by 166 votes to 127. His escape could not, however,
prevent his fall, and he resigned the secretaryship on the 11th of
September 1674, being appointed lord chamberlain instead.
In 1675 he made another attempt to gain favour with the parliament
by supporting measures against France and against the
Roman Catholics, and by joining in the pressure put upon Charles
to remove James from the court. In November he went on a
mission to the Hague, with the popular objects of effecting a
peace and of concluding an alliance with William and James&rsquo;s
daughter Mary. In this he entirely failed, and he returned home
completely discredited. He had again been disappointed of the
treasurership when Danby succeeded Clifford; Charles having
declared &ldquo;that he had too much kindness for him to let him have
it, for he was not fit for the office.&rdquo;<a name="fa7m" id="fa7m" href="#ft7m"><span class="sp">7</span></a> His intrigues with discontented
persons in parliament to stir up an opposition to his
successful rival came to nothing. From this time, though
lingering on at court, he possessed no influence, and was treated
with scanty respect. It was safe to ridicule his person and
behaviour, and it became a common jest for &ldquo;some courtier to put
a black patch upon his nose and strut about with a white staff in
his hand in order to make the king merry at his expense.&rdquo;<a name="fa8m" id="fa8m" href="#ft8m"><span class="sp">8</span></a>
He was appointed a commissioner of the treasury in March 1679,
was included in Sir William Temple&rsquo;s new modelled council the
same year, and was a member of the inner cabinet which was
almost immediately formed. In 1681 he was made lord lieutenant
of Suffolk. He died on the 28th of July 1685, and was buried at
Euston, where he had bought a large estate and had carried out
extensive building operations. His residence in London was Goring
House, on the site of which was built the present Arlington Street.</p>

<p>Arlington was a typical statesman of the Restoration, possessing
outwardly an attractive personality, and according to Sir
W. Temple &ldquo;the greatest skill of court and the best turns of art
in particular conversation,&rdquo;<a name="fa9m" id="fa9m" href="#ft9m"><span class="sp">9</span></a> but thoroughly unscrupulous and
self-seeking, without a spark of patriotism, faithless even to a
bad cause, and regarding public office solely as a means of
procuring pleasure and profit. His knowledge of foreign affairs
and of foreign languages, gained during his residence abroad,
was considerable, but long absence from England had also taught
him a cosmopolitan indifference to constitutions and religions,
and a careless disregard for English public opinion and the
essential interests of the country. According to Clarendon, he
&ldquo;knew no more of the constitution and laws of England than he
did of China, nor had he in truth a care or tenderness for church
or state, but believed France was the best pattern in the world.&rdquo;<a name="fa10m" id="fa10m" href="#ft10m"><span class="sp">10</span></a>
He was one of the chief promoters of the attempt to reintroduce
into England arbitrary government after the French model, not
because he imagined an absolute monarchy essential to the
well-being and security of the state, but because under such an
administration the favourites of a king enjoyed far greater privileges and
profits than under a constitutional government. Of the same
egotistical character was his religion, towards which his
attitude was similar to that of Charles II. himself. He was credited
with having inclined the king towards Romanism. Before the
Restoration he had attended mass with the king abroad, and in
opposition to Lord Bristol had urged Charles to declare publicly
his conversion in order to obtain the long-expected succour from
the foreign powers. But his religion sat lightly upon him as it
did upon his master, and it was often convenient to disguise it.
Like the king he continued to profess and practise Protestantism,
and spent large sums in restoring the church at Euston; and,
unlike Clifford, he took the Test in 1673 and remained in office,
successfully concealing his faith till on his deathbed, when he
declared himself an adherent of Roman Catholicism.<a name="fa11m" id="fa11m" href="#ft11m"><span class="sp">11</span></a></p>

<p>He married Isabella of Beerwaert, daughter of Louis of Nassau,
by whom he had one daughter, Isabella, who married Henry,
duke of Grafton, the natural son of Charles II. and Lady
Castlemaine.</p>

2387 were foreign-born; (1910 census) 11,187. Area, 5½ sq. m.
It is served by the Boston &amp; Maine railway. It has pleasant

Robbins library). At Arlington Heights there are several well-known
sanatoriums. Spy Pond (about 100 acres) is one of the
prettiest bodies of water in the vicinity of Boston. Arlington is
an important centre for market-gardening (in hot-houses), and
along Mill Brook, in the township, are several factories, including
chrome works, a large mill and a manufactory of pianoforte
cases. In 1762 Arlington was made a &ldquo;precinct&rdquo; of Cambridge
(of which it was a part from 1635 to 1807) under the name of
Menotomy. In 1807 it became a separate township under the
name (retained until 1867) of West Cambridge.</p>

<p><span class="bold">ARLON,<a name="ar122" id="ar122"></a></span> the chief town of the Belgian province of Luxemburg,
situated on a hill about 1240 ft. above the sea. Pop. (1904)
10,894. It is a very ancient town, and in the time of the Romans
was called Orolaunum, being a station on the Antoninian way
connecting Reims and Trèves. Authorities dispute as to the
origin of the name, some tracing it to <i>Ara Lunae</i>, a temple of
Diana having been erected here, while others more plausibly
derive it from the Celtic words <i>ar</i> (mount) and <i>lun</i> (wooded).
Nowadays the woods have disappeared, and Arlon is chiefly
notable for the extensive views obtainable from the church of St
Donat which crowns the peak. Arlon is no longer fortified.
When Vauban by order of Louis XIV. turned it into a fortress
in 1671 great damage was done to the old Roman wall, the foundations
of which were practically intact. In the local museum
are many Roman antiquities collected on the spot, including
several large sculptural stones similar to the celebrated monument
at Igel near Trèves. In the middle ages Arlon was the seat of
a powerful countship (later marquisate), held after 1235 by the
dukes of Luxemburg. As an important strategic position it was

<p><span class="bold">ARMADA, THE.<a name="ar124" id="ar124"></a></span> The Spanish or Invincible Armada was the
great fleet (in Spanish, <i>armada</i>) sent against England by Philip II.
in 1588. The marquis of Santa Cruz, to whom the command had
first been given, died on the 9th of February 1588 (according to
the Gregorian calendar then used by Spain; on the 31st of
January by the Julian calendar used in England; the other dates
given in this article will be in Old Style, or Julian calendar).
Santa Cruz was succeeded by Don Alonso Perez de Guzman, duke
of Medina Sidonia, a noble of large estate, but of no experience or
capacity, who took the command unwillingly, and only on the
reiterated order of the king. The fleet was collected at Lisbon,
after many delays, and sailed on the 20th of May 1588. Its
nominal strength was 132 vessels, of 59,190 tons, carrying 21,621
soldiers and 8066 sailors. But from a third to a half of the
vessels were transports, galleys or very small boats, and some
of them never reached the Channel. The effective force was
far below the paper strength. On the 10th of June, when the
Armada had rounded Cape Finisterre, it was scattered by squalls.
Some of the vessels went on to the appointed rendezvous at the
Scilly Isles, but the majority anchored on the north coast of
Spain. Medina Sidonia, who found many defects in his fleet, did
not finally sail till the 12th of July. On the English side all the
royal navy, and such armed merchant ships as could be obtained
from the ports, had been collected under the command of the
lord high admiral Howard of Effingham, who had with him
Hawkins, Drake and Frobisher as subordinate admirals. The
number of vessels is put at 197, but the majority were very small.
It is impossible to state with confidence what were the relative
numbers of guns carried by the two fleets. The Spaniards had
more pieces, but their gunnery was inferior. The English fleet
carried 16,000 or 17,000 men, of whom the large majority were
sailors. About 100 of their ships were at Plymouth with the
lord high admiral. The others were in the Downs with Lord
Henry Seymour and Sir William Winter, to co-operate with a
Dutch squadron under Justinus of Nassau in blockading the
Flemish ports, then occupied by the Spanish army of the duke of
Parma. The object was to prevent the proposed junction of the
forces of Medina Sidonia and Parma. On the 20th of July the
Armada was seen off the Lizard. It sailed past Plymouth, and
was followed by the English fleet. The Spaniards, who were
heavy sailers, and were hampered by the transports, were much
harassed by the more active English, and were defeated in all their
attempts to board, which it was their wish to do in order to make
use of their superior numbers of men. The flagship of the
squadron of Andalucia, &ldquo;Nuestra Señora del Rosario,&rdquo; commanded
by Don Pedro de Valdes, was crippled, fell behind and
had to surrender. On the 25th of July, when the fleets were near
the Isle of Wight, a shift of the wind offered the Spaniards a
chance of bringing on a close action, but it soon changed again.
The English fleet, of which part had been in some danger, escaped
uninjured, and the Spaniards stood on. They anchored on the
26th of July at Calais. The duke of Medina Sidonia now sent an
officer to Parma, calling on him to come to sea and join in a
landing on the shore of England. But Parma could not leave
port in face of Justinus of Nassau&rsquo;s squadron. While these
messages were going and coming, Lord Howard had been joined
by Lord Henry Seymour and Sir William Winter from the
Downs. A council of war was held, to decide on the measures to
be taken to assail the Spaniards at Calais. The course taken was
to send fireships among them. On the night of the 28th of July
the fireships were sent in, and produced an utter panic in the
Armada. Most of the Spanish vessels slipped their cables and
ran to sea. Others weighed anchor, and escaped in a more
orderly style. One great vessel ran ashore and was taken
possession of by the English, who were however compelled to
give her up by the French governor of Calais. On the 29th of
July the scattered Spaniards, who were quite unable to restore
order, were attacked by the English off Gravelines. The engagement
was hot, and, though the English did not succeed in taking
any of the Spaniards, they destroyed some of them, and their
superiority in sailing force and gunnery was now so obvious that
the duke of Medina Sidonia lost heart. His large vessels were
indeed so helpless that only a timely shift of the wind saved many
of them from drifting on to the banks of Flanders. Officers and
men alike were completely discouraged. It was now recognized
that an invasion of England could not be carried out in face of the
more active English fleet and the proved impossibility of bringing
about the proposed union with Parma&rsquo;s army. Suggestions were
made that the Armada should sail to Hamburg, refit there, and
renew the attack. But by this time the Spanish force was
incapable of energetic action. Medina Sidonia and his council
could think of nothing but of a return to Spain. As the wind
was westerly, and the English fleet barred the way, it was
impossible to sail down the Channel. The only alternative was to
take the route between the north of Scotland and Norway. So
the Armada sailed to the north. Lord Howard followed, after
detaching Lord Henry Seymour to remain in the Downs. He
watched the Spaniards to the Firth of Forth. The English had
at that time little knowledge of the seas beyond the Firth, and
they were beginning to run short of food and ammunition. On
the 2nd of August, therefore, they gave up the pursuit. Medina
Sidonia continued to the north, till his pilots told him that it was
safe to turn to the west. Up to this time the loss of the Spaniards
in ships had not been considerable. If the weather had been that
of a normal summer, they would probably have reached home
with no greater loss of men than was usually inflicted on all fleets
of the age by scurvy and fever. But the summer of 1588 was
marked by a succession of gales of unprecedented violence. The
damaged and weakened Spanish ships, which were from the first
greatly undermanned in sailors, were unable to contend with the
storms. It is not possible to give the details of the disasters
which overtook them. Nineteen of them are known to have
been wrecked on the coasts of Scotland and Ireland. The
crews who fell into the hands of the English officers in Ireland
were put to the sword. Many more of them disappeared at sea.
Of the total number of the vessels originally collected for the
invasion of England one-half, if not more, perished, and the
crews of those which escaped were terribly diminished by scurvy
and starvation.</p>

<p>The failure of the Armada was mainly due to its own interior
weakness, and as a military operation the English victory was
less glorious than some other less renowned achievements of the
British fleet. But the repulse of the great Spanish armament was
an event of the first historical importance. It marked the final
failure of King Philip II. of Spain to establish the supremacy
of the Habsburg dynasty and of the Church of Rome, which he
considered as being in a peculiar sense his charge, in Europe.
From that time forward no serious attempt to invade England
was, or could be, made. It became therefore the unconquerable
supporter of that part of Europe which had thrown off the
authority of the pope. The Armada had much of the character
of a crusade. Though Philip II. had political reasons for
hostility to Queen Elizabeth, they were so intimately bound
up with the struggle between the Reformation and the Counter
Reformation that the secular and the religious elements of the
conflict cannot be separated from one another. The struggle
was therefore not one between armed forces in national rivalry
alone. It was a trial of strength between two widely different
conceptions of life and of the state&mdash;between the medieval and
the modern worlds. The volunteers of all ranks who came
forward in large numbers on both sides were fighting for a
religious cause as well as for the interests of their respective
peoples.</p>

<p><span class="bold">ARMADILLO,<a name="ar125" id="ar125"></a></span> the Spanish designation for the small mail-clad
Central and South American mammals of the order Edentata,
constituting the family <i>Dasypodidae</i>. The armature consists of a
bony case, partly composed of solid buckler-like plates, and partly
of movable transverse bands, the latter differing in number with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page561" id="page561"></a>561</span>
the species, and giving to the body a considerable degree of
flexibility. The bony plates are overlain by horny scales.
Armadillos are omnivorous, feeding on roots, insects, worms,
reptiles and carrion, and are mostly, though not universally,
nocturnal. They are harmless and inoffensive creatures, offering
no resistance when caught; their principal means of escape being
the extraordinary rapidity with which they burrow in the
ground, and the tenacity with which they retain their hold in
their subterranean retreats. Notwithstanding the shortness of
their limbs they run with rapidity. Most of the species are
esteemed good eating by the natives of the countries in which
they live. They are all inhabitants of the open plains or the
forests of the tropical and temperate parts of South America,
with the exception of a few species which range as far north as
Texas. The largest species is the giant armadillo (<i>Priodon
gigas</i>), measuring nearly a yard long, from the forests of Surinam
and Brazil; while one of the smallest is <i>Dasypus minutus</i>, a near
ally of the larger <i>D. sexcinctus</i>. The peba (<i>Tatusia novemcincta</i>)
represents a group with a large number of movable bands in the
armour; while the apar (<i>Tolypeutes tricinctus</i>) and the other
members of the same genus are remarkable for their power of
rolling themselves up into balls. For the distinctive characters
of these and the other genera see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Edentata</a></span>.</p>

<p><span class="bold">ARMAGEDDON,<a name="ar126" id="ar126"></a></span> a name occurring in the Authorized Version
of the English Bible in Rev. xvi. 16. The Revised Version has
Harmagedon. The form is commonly regarded as the Greek
equivalent of the Hebrew <i>har megidd&#333;n</i>, the mountain district of
Megiddo. The writer is describing the place where the last
decisive battle was to be fought at the Day of Judgment, and
Harmagedon may have been chosen as the name because the
district about Megiddo had been on several occasions the scene
of great battles (cf. Judg. iv. 6 ff., v. 19). It has, however,
been suggested in the <i>Zeitschrift für die Alttestamentliche
Wissenschaft</i>, vii. 170 (1887), that the name is for <i>har migdo</i>, &ldquo;his
fruitful mountain&rdquo;&mdash;the mountain land of Israel. Prof. Cheyne
(<i>Encyc. Bibl.</i> s.v.) again, following suggestions of H. Gunkel,
H. Zimmern and P. Jensen, compares the dragon of the Apocalypse
with the Babylonian Ti&#257;mat, thinks that some myth is
referred to, and finds the <span class="grk" title="magedon">&#956;&#945;&#947;&#949;&#948;&#969;&#957;</span> of <span class="grk" title="Harmagedon">&#7944;&#961;&#956;&#945;&#947;&#949;&#948;&#969;&#957;</span> in the divine
name <span class="grk" title="Yesemmigadon">&#8025;&#949;&#963;&#949;&#956;&#956;&#953;&#947;&#945;&#948;&#969;&#957;</span>, a Babylonian god of the underworld. The
name of the place where Ti&#257;mat was defeated by Marduk perhaps
included that of a god of the underworld. (See <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Antichrist</a></span>.)
From the application of the word Armageddon to the great
battle of the End of Time comes the use of the phrase &ldquo;an
Armageddon&rdquo; to express any great slaughter or final conflict.</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">ARMAGH,<a name="ar127" id="ar127"></a></span> an inland county of Ireland, in the province of
Ulster, bounded N. by Lough Neagh, E. by Co. Down, S. by
Louth and W. by Monaghan and Tyrone. The area is 327,704
acres, or about 512 sq. m. The general surface of the county is
gently undulating and pleasantly diversified; but in the northern
extremity, on the borders of Lough Neagh, there is a considerable
tract of low, marshy land, and the southern border of the county
is occupied by a barren range of hills, the highest of which, Slieve
Gullion, attains an elevation of 1893 ft. In the western portion of
the county are the Few Mountains, a chain of abrupt hills mostly
incapable of cultivation. The county is well watered by numerous
streams. The principal are the Callan, the Tynan and the
Tallwater, flowing into the Blackwater, which, after forming the
boundary between this county and Tyrone, empties itself into
the south-western angle of Lough Neagh. The Tara and
Newtown-Hamilton, the Creggan and the Fleury, flow into the bay
of Dundalk. The Cam or Camlin joins the Bann, which, crossing
the north-western corner of the county, falls into Lough Neagh
to the east of the Blackwater. The Newry Canal, communicating
with Carlingford Lough at Warrenpoint, 6 m. below Newry,
proceeds northward through Co. Armagh for about 21 m.,
joining the Bann at Whitecoat. The Ulster Canal begins at
Charlemont on the river Blackwater, near its junction with
Lough Neagh, proceeding through the western border of the
county, and passing thence to the south-west by Monaghan and
Clones into Upper Lough Erne, after a course of 48 m. Part of
Lough Neagh is in the county, and there are many small loughs,
such as Gullion, Cam and Ross.</p>

<p><i>Geology.</i>&mdash;The flat shore of Lough Neagh in the north is due
to the thick deposit of pale-coloured clays with lignites, which are
probably of Pliocene age, and indicate a reduction of the area of
the lake in still later times. Between this lowland and Armagh
city, the early Cainozoic basalts form slightly higher ground,
while on the west a strip of Trias appears, overlying Carboniferous
Limestone. A rough conglomerate containing blocks of this
latter rock forms the hills on which Armagh itself is built; this
outlier is probably Permian. The Carboniferous Limestone
beneath it and around it is red-brown instead of grey, and is
famous for its richness in fish remains. A hummocky irregular
country spreads southward, where the Silurian axis is encountered,
in continuation of the southern uplands of Scotland. Slates and
fine-grained sandstones appear here freely through the glacial
drift. In the south the granite core of this upland is revealed,
and is quarried extensively about Bessbrook. It is penetrated
by far younger intrusive masses at Slieve Gullion and Forkill.
These rocks, which include some highly siliceous lavas, form part
of the Eocene series that is so conspicuously displayed above
Carlingford in Co. Louth. Lead-veins have been worked in
various parts of the county from time to time.</p>

<p><i>Industries.</i>&mdash;The soil of the northern portion of the county is
a rich brown loam, on a substratum of clay or gravel. Towards
Charlemont there is much reclaimable bog resting on a limestone
substratum. The eastern portion of the county is generally of a
light friable soil; the southern portion rocky and barren, with
but little bog except in the neighbourhood of Newtown-Hamilton.
The climate of Armagh is considered to be one of the most genial
in Ireland, and less rain is supposed to fall in this than in any
other county. Only about one-twentieth of the land is naturally
barren, and Armagh offers a relatively large area of cultivable
soil. Agriculture, however, is not far advanced, yet owing to the
linen industry the inhabitants are generally in circumstances of
comparative comfort. The principal crops are oats and potatoes,
but all grain crops are decreasing, and flax, formerly grown to a
considerable extent, is now practically neglected. The acreage
under pasture slightly exceeds that of tillage. Cattle, sheep, pigs
and poultry show a general increase in numbers. The principal
manufacture, and that which has given a peculiar tone to the
character of the population, is that of linen, though it has
somewhat declined in modern times. It is not necessary to the
promotion of this manufacture that the spinners and weavers
should be congregated in large towns, or united in crowded and
unwholesome factories. On the contrary, most of its branches
can be carried on in the cottages of the peasantry. The men
devote to the loom those hours which are not required for the
cultivation of their little farms; the women spin and reel the yarn
during the intervals of their other domestic occupations. Smooth
lawns, pure springs and the open sky are necessary for perfecting
the bleaching process. Hence the numerous bleachers dwell in the
country with their assistants and machinery. Such is the effect
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page562" id="page562"></a>562</span>
of this combination of agricultural occupations with domestic
manufactures that the farmers are more than competent to
supply the resident population of the county with vegetable,
though not with animal food; and some of the less crowded
and less productive parts of Ulster receive from Armagh a
considerable supply of oats, barley and flour. Apples are grown
in such quantities as to entitle the county to the title applied
to it, the orchard of Ireland.</p>

<p>Communications are monopolized by the Great Northern railway
company, whose main line from Belfast divides at Portadown,
sending off lines to Omagh, to Clones and to Dublin. A branch
from Omagh joins the Dublin line to Goraghwood, and from this
line there is a branch to Newry in Co. Down. An electric
tram-way connects Bessbrook, a town with important linen
manufactures and granite quarries, with Newry.</p>

<p><i>Population and Administration.</i>&mdash;The population (72,286 in
1891; 65,619 in 1901) shows a heavy decrease, though emigration
affects it less seriously than the majority of Irish counties. Of
the total about 45% are Roman Catholics, 32% Protestant
Episcopalians, and 16% Presbyterians, the Roman Catholic faith
prevailing in the mountainous districts and the Protestant in the
towns and lowlands. About 74% of the whole constitutes the
rural population. The chief towns are Armagh (a city and the
county town, pop. 7588), Lurgan (11,782), Portadown (10,092),
Tanderagee (1427), Bessbrook (2977) and Keady (1466). Armagh
is divided into eight baronies, and contains twenty-five parishes
and parts of parishes, the greater number of which are in the
Protestant and Roman Catholic dioceses of Armagh, and a few
in the Roman Catholic diocese of Dromore. The constabulary
has its headquarters at Armagh, the county being divided into
five districts. Assizes are held at Armagh, and quarter sessions
at Armagh, Ballybot, Lurgan, Markethill and Newtown-Hamilton.
The parliamentary divisions are three: mid, north and south,
each returning one member.</p>

<p><i>History and Antiquities.</i>&mdash;Armagh, together with Louth,
Monaghan and some smaller districts, formed part of a territory
called Orgial or Urial, which was long subject to the occasional
incursions of the Danes. The county was made shire ground in
1586, and called Armagh after the city by Sir John Perrott.
When James I. proceeded to plant with English and Scottish
colonists the vast tracts escheated to the crown in Ulster, the
whole of the arable and pasture land in Armagh, estimated at
77,800 acres, was to have been allotted in sixty-one portions.
Nineteen of these, comprising 22,180 acres, were to have been
allotted to the church, and forty-two, amounting to 55,620
acres, to English and Scottish colonists, servitors, native Irish
and four corporate towns&mdash;the swordsmen to be dispersed
throughout Connaught and Munster. This project was not
strictly adhered to in Co. Armagh, nor were the Irish swordsmen
or soldiers transplanted into Connaught and Munster from this
and some other counties. The antiquities consist of cairns and
tumuli; the remains of the fortress of Emain near the city of
Armagh (<i>q.v.</i>), once the residence of the kings of Ulster; and
Danes Cast, an extensive fortification in the south-east of the
county, near Poyntzpass, extending into Co. Down. Spears,
battle-axes, collars, rings, amulets, medals of gold, ornaments of
silver, jet and amber, &amp;c., have also been found in various places.
The religious houses were at Armagh, Killevy, Kilmore, Stradhailloyse
and Tahenny. Of military antiquities the most remarkable
are Tyrone&rsquo;s ditches, near Poyntzpass; and the pass of
Moyry, the entry into the county from the south, which was
fiercely contested by the Irish in 1595 and 1600, is defended by a
castle. The summit of Slieve Gullion is crowned by a large cairn,
which forms the roof of a singular cavern of artificial construction,
probably an early burial-place.</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">ARMAGH,<a name="ar128" id="ar128"></a></span> a city and market town, and the county town of
Co. Armagh, Ireland, in the mid parliamentary division, 89½ m.
N.N.W. of Dublin by the Great Northern railway, at the junction
of the Belfast-Clones line. Pop. (1901) 7588. It is said to derive
its name of <i>Ard-macha</i>, the Hill of Macha, from Queen Macha of
the Golden Hair, who flourished in the middle of the 4th century
<span class="scs">B.C.</span> but earlier it was named from its situation on the sides of a
steep hill called Drumsailech, or the Hill of Sallows, which rises
in the midst of a fertile plain near the Callan stream. Of high
antiquity, and, like many other Irish towns, claiming (with
considerable probability) to have been founded by St Patrick
in the 5th century, it long possessed the more important distinction
of being the metropolis of Ireland; and, as the seat of a
flourishing college, was greatly frequented by students from other
lands, among whom the English and Scots were said to have
been so numerous as to give the name of Trian-Sassanagh, or
Saxon Street, to one of the quarters of the city. St Patrick&rsquo;s bell,
long preserved at Armagh, the oldest Irish relic of its kind, is
now, with its shrine of the year 1091, preserved in the museum
of the Royal Irish Academy at Dublin. Of a synod that was held
at Armagh as early as 448, there is an interesting memorial in the
<i>Book of Armagh</i>, an Irish MS. dating about <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 800. Exposed
to the successive calamities of the Danish incursions, the English
conquest and the English wars, and at last deserted by its
bishops, who retired to Drogheda, the venerable city sank into an
insignificant collection of cabins, with a dilapidated cathedral.
From this state of decay, however, it was raised, in the second
half of the 18th century, by the unwearied exertions of
Archbishop Richard Robinson, 1st Lord Rokeby (1709-1794),
which, seconded by similar devotion on the part of succeeding
archbishops of the Beresford family, notably Archbishop Lord
John George Beresford (1773-1862), made of Armagh one of the
best built and most respectable towns in the country. As the
ecclesiastical metropolis and seat of an archbishop (Primate of all
Ireland) in both the Protestant and Roman organizations, it
possesses two cathedrals and two archiepiscopal palaces. As the
county town Armagh has a court-house, a prison, a lunatic asylum
and a county infirmary. Besides these there is a fever hospital,
erected by Lord John George Beresford; a college, which Primate
Robinson was anxious to raise to the rank of a university; a
public library founded by him, an observatory, which has become
famous from the efficiency of its astronomers; a number of
churches and schools, and barracks. Almost all the buildings are
built of the limestone of the district, but the Anglican cathedral
is of red sandstone. It stands boldly on the top of the hill, a
cruciform structure dating from the 13th, but practically rebuilt
in the 18th century, in accordance with its original plan. The
Roman Catholic cathedral is in the Decorated style, and was
consecrated in 1873. Armagh was a parliamentary borough until
1885; and, having been incorporated in 1613, so remained until
1835. The administration is in the hands of an urban district
council. Two miles W. of Armagh is Emain, Emania, or Navan
Fort, with large entrenchments and mounds, the site of a royal
palace of Ulster, founded by that Queen Macha who gave her
name to the city. In <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 335 it was destroyed during the inroad
on the defeat of the king of Ulster by the three brothers Colla,
cousins of Muredach, king of Ireland. Armagh itself fell before
the king Brian Boroime, who was buried here; and before
Edward Bruce in 1315, while previous to the English war after the
Reformation, it had witnessed the struggles of Shane O&rsquo;Neill
(1564).</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">ARMAGNAC,<a name="ar129" id="ar129"></a></span> formerly a province of France and the most
important fief of Gascony, now wholly comprised in the department
of Gers (<i>q.v.</i>). In the 15th century, when it attained its
greatest extent, it included, besides Armagnac, the neighbouring
territories of Fezensac, Fezensaguet, Pardiac, Pays de Gaure,
Rivière Basse, Eauzan and Lomagne, and stretched from the
Garonne to the Adour. Armagnac is a region of hills ranging to a
height of 1000 ft., watered by the river Gers and other rivers which
descend fanwise from the plateau of Lannemezan. On the slope
of its hills grow the grapes from which the famous Armagnac
brandy is made. In Roman Gaul this territory formed part of
the diocese of Auch (<i>civitas Ausciorum</i>), which corresponded
roughly with the later duchy of Gascony (<i>q.v.</i>). About the end
of the 9th century Fezensac (<i>comitatus Fedentiacus</i>), in
circumstances of which no trustworthy record remains, was erected
into an hereditary countship. This latter was in its turn
divided, the south-western portion becoming, about 960, the
countship of Armagnac (<i>pagus Armaniacus</i>). The domain of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page563" id="page563"></a>563</span>
this countship, at first very limited in extent, continued steadily
to increase in size, and about 1140 Count Gerald III. added the
whole of Fezensac to his possessions. Under the English rule
the counts of Armagnac were turbulent and untrustworthy
vassals; and the administration of the Black Prince, tending to
favour the towns of Aquitaine at the expense of the nobles, drove
them to the side of France. The complaint against the English
prince which Count John I., in defiance of the treaty of Brétigny,
himself carried to Paris, was the principal cause of the resumption
of hostilities of 1369, and of the incessant defeats sustained by
the English until the accession of their king Henry V.</p>

<p>At that moment Count Bernard VII. was all-powerful at the
French court; and Charles of Orleans, in order to be able to
avenge his father, Louis of Orleans, who had been assassinated in
1407 by John the Fearless, duke of Burgundy, married Bonne,
Bernard&rsquo;s daughter. This was the origin of the political party
known as &ldquo;the Armagnacs.&rdquo; With the object of combating the
duke of Burgundy&rsquo;s preponderant influence, a league was
formed at Gien, including the duke of Orleans and his father-in-law,
the dukes of Berry, Bourbon and Brittany, the count of
Alençon and all the other discontented nobles. Bernard VII.
ravaged the environs of Paris; and the treaty of Bicêtre
(November 2, 1410) only suspended hostilities for a few months,
war breaking out afresh in the spring of 1411. Paris sided
with the duke of Burgundy, and at his instigation Charles VII.
collected an army to besiege the allies in Bourges. The peace of
Bourges, confirmed at Auxerre on the 22nd of August, put an end
to the war. Paris was dominated at that time by the party of the
&ldquo;butchers,&rdquo; or <i>Cabochiens</i>, which had been organized and armed
by the count of Saint-Pol, brother-in-law of John the Fearless.
But their excesses, and in particular the Cabochien ordinance
of the 25th of May 1413, aroused public indignation; a reaction
took place, and in the month of August the Armagnacs in their
turn became masters of the government and of the king. The
duke of Burgundy, besieged in Arras, only obtained peace
(treaty of Arras, September 4, 1414), on condition of not
returning to Paris.</p>

<p>Several months later Henry V. declared war against France;
and when, in August 1415, the English landed in Normandy, the
Armagnacs and Burgundians united against them, but were
defeated in the battle of Agincourt (October 25, 1415). John
the Fearless then began negotiations with the English, while
Bernard VII., appointed constable in place of the count of Saint-Pol,
who had been killed at Agincourt, returned to defend Paris.
However, the excesses committed by the Armagnacs incensed the
populace, and John the Fearless, who was ravaging the surrounding
districts, re-entered the capital on the 29th of May 1418, in
consequence of the treason of Perrinet Leclerc. On the 12th of
June Bernard VII. and the members of his party were massacred.
From this time onward the Armagnac party, with the dauphin,
afterwards King Charles VII., at its head, was the national party,
while the Burgundians united with the English. This division in
France continued until the treaty of Arras, on the 21st of
September 1435. The rivalry of the Burgundians and Armagnacs
brought terrible disasters upon France, and for many years afterwards
the name of &ldquo;Armagnacs&rdquo; was bestowed upon the bands
of adventurers who were as much to be feared as the <i>Grandes
Compagnies</i> of the preceding age.</p>

<p>In 1444-45 the emperor Frederick III. of Germany obtained
from Charles VII. a large army of Armagnacs to enforce his
claims in Switzerland, and the war which ensued took the name
of the Armagnac war (<i>Armagnakenkrieg</i>). In Germany the
name of the foreigners, who were completely defeated in the
battle of St Jakob on the Birs, not far from Basel, was mockingly
corrupted into <i>Arme Jacken</i>, Poor Jackets, or <i>Arme Gecken</i>,
Poor Fools.</p>

<p>On the death of Charles of Armagnac, in 1497, the countship
was united to the crown by King Charles VII., but was again
bestowed on Charles, the nephew of that count, by Francis I.,
who at the same time gave him his sister Margaret in marriage.
After the death of her husband, by whom she had no children, she
married Henry of Albret, king of Navarre; and thus the countship
of Armagnac came back to the French crown along with the
other dominions of Henry IV. In 1645 Louis XIV. erected a
countship of Armagnac in favour of Henry of Lorraine, count of
Harcourt, in whose family it continued till the Revolution.
James of Armagnac, grandson of Bernard VII., was made duke
of Nemours in 1462, and was succeeded in the dukedom by his
second son, John, who died without issue, and his third son, Louis,
in whom the house of Armagnac became extinct in 1503.</p>

<p>In 1789 Armagnac was a province forming part of the
<i>Gouvernement-général</i> of Guienne and Gascony; it was divided
into two parts, High or White Armagnac, with Auch for capital,
and Low or Black Armagnac. At the Revolution the whole of
the original Armagnac was included in the department of Gers.</p>

to some Greeks who discharged certain military and police
functions under the Turkish government. When the Turks under
Sultan Mahommed II. conquered Greece in the 15th century, many
of the Greeks fled into the mountainous districts of Macedonia
and northern Greece, and maintained a harassing warfare with the
conquerors of their country. These men were called <i>Klephts</i>
(modern Gr. <span class="grk" title="klephtaes">&#954;&#955;&#941;&#966;&#964;&#951;&#962;</span>, ancient <span class="grk" title="kleptaes">&#954;&#955;&#941;&#960;&#964;&#951;&#962;</span>, a thief, a brigand), and
during the 16th century the Turkish pashas came to terms with
some of them, and these men were allowed to retain their local
customs, and were confirmed in the possession of certain districts,
while in return they undertook some duties, such as the custody
of the highroads. Those who accepted these terms were called
<i>armatoles</i>, and the districts in which they lived <i>armatoliks</i>.
Strengthened by a considerable number of Christian Albanians,
they rendered good service in defending Greece, and to some
extent repressed the ravages of the <i>Klephts</i>; but their power and
independence were disliked by the Turks. After the peace of
Belgrade in 1739 (between Austria and Turkey), the Turkish
government sought to weaken the position of the <i>armatoles</i>.
Their privileges were restricted, Mahommedan Albanians were
introduced into the <i>armatoliks</i>, and towards the end of the 18th
century their numbers were seriously reduced. Irritated by this
policy the <i>armatoles</i> rendered considerable service to Ali Pasha of
Iannina in his struggle with the Turks in 1820-22, and afforded
valuable assistance to their countrymen during the Greek war of
independence in 1830.</p>

<p><span class="bold">ARMATURE<a name="ar131" id="ar131"></a></span> (from Lat. <i>armatura</i>, armour), a covering for

which the lead lights are secured in windows. (See <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Stanchion</a></span>

<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">ARMENIA<a name="ar133" id="ar133"></a></span> (old Persian <i>Armina</i>, Armenian <i>Hayasdan</i>, or
<i>Hayq</i>), the popular modern name of a district south of the
Caucasus and Black Sea, which formed part of the ancient
Armenian kingdom. The name, which first occurs in the cuneiform
inscriptions of Darius Hystaspis, supplanted the earlier
Urardhu, or Ararat, but its origin is unknown. In its widest
extent Armenia stretched from 37° to 49° E. long., and from
37½° to 41½° N. lat.; but this area was never, or only for a brief
period, united under one king. Armenia is now divided between
Persia, Russia and Turkey, and the three boundaries have a
common point on Little Ararat.</p>

<p>Geographically, Armenia is a continuation westward of the
great Iranian plateau. On the north it descends abruptly to the
Black Sea; on the south it breaks down in rugged terraces to the
lowlands of Mesopotamia; and on the east and west it sinks
more gradually to the lower plateaus of Persia and Asia Minor.
Above the general level of the plateau, 6000 ft., rise bare ranges
of mountains, which run from north-east to south-west at an
altitude of 8000-12,000 ft., and culminate in Ararat, 17,000 ft.
Between the ranges are broad elevated valleys, through which the
rivers of the plateau flow before entering the rugged gorges that
convey their waters to lower levels. Geologically, Armenia
consists of archaic rocks upon which, towards the north, are
superimposed Palaeozoic, and towards the south later sedimentary
rocks. The last have been pierced by volcanic outbursts
that extend southward to Lake Van. Amongst the higher
mountains are the two Ararats; Ala-geuz Dagh, north of the
Aras; Bingeul Dagh, south of Erzerum; and the peaks near
Lake Van. The rivers are the Euphrates, Tigris, Aras, Churuk
Su (Chorokh) and Kelkit Irmak, all rising on the plateau. The
more important lakes are Van, 5100 ft., about twice the size of the
Lake of Geneva, and Urmia, 4000 ft., both salt; Gokcha or
Sevan, 5870 ft., discharging into the Aras; and Chaldir, into the
Kars Chai. The aspect of the plateau is dreary and monotonous.
The valleys are wide expanses of arable land, and the hills are for
the most part grass-covered and treeless. But the gorges of the
Euphrates and Tigris, and their tributaries, cannot be surpassed
in wildness and grandeur. The climate is varied. In the higher
districts the winter is long and the cold severe; whilst the summer
is short, dry and hot. In Erzerum the temperature ranges from
&minus;22° to 84° F., and snow sometimes falls in June. In the valley
of the Aras, and in the western and southern districts, the
climate is more moderate. Most of the towns lie high, from 4000
to 6000 ft. The villages are usually built on gentle slopes, in
which the houses are partially excavated as a protection against
the severity of the weather. Many of the early towns were on or
near the Araxes, and amongst their ruins are the remains of
churches which throw light on the history of Christian architecture
in the East. Armenia is rich in mineral wealth, and there
are many hot and cold mineral springs. The vegetation varies
according to the locality. Cereals and hardy fruits grow on the
higher ground, whilst rice is cultivated in the hot, well-watered
valley of the Araxes. The summer is so hot that the vine grows
at much higher altitudes than it does in western Europe, and the
cotton tree and all southern fruit trees are cultivated in the
deeper valleys. On the fine pasture lands which now support the
flocks of the Kurds, the horses and mules, so celebrated in ancient
times, were reared. Trout are found in the rivers, and a small
herring in Lake Van. The country abounds in romantic scenery;
that of the district of Ararat especially has been celebrated by
patriotic historians like Moses of Chorene and Lazarus of Pharb.</p>

<p><i>Population</i>.&mdash;Accurate statistics cannot be obtained; but it
is estimated that in the nine vilayets, which include Turkish
Armenia, there are 925,000 Gregorian, Roman Catholic and
Protestant Armenians, 645,000 other Christians, 100,000 Jews,
Gypsies, &amp;c., and 4,460,000 Moslems. The Armenians, taking
the most favourable estimate, are in a majority in nine kazas or
sub-districts only (seven near Van, and two near Mush) out of 159.
In Russian Armenia there are 960,000 Armenians, and in Persian
Armenia 130,000. According to an estimate made by General
Zelenyi for the Caucasus Geographical Society (<i>Zapiski</i>, vol.
xviii., Tiflis, 1896, with map), the population of the nine Turkish
vilayets, Erzerum, Van, Bitlis, Kharput (Mamuret-el-Aziz).
Diarbekr, Sivas, Aleppo, Adana and Trebizond, was 6,000,000
(Armenians, 913,875, or 15%; other Christians, 632,875, or 11%;
and Moslems, 4,453,250, or 74%). In the first five vilayets which
contain most of the Armenians, the population was 2,642,000
(Armenians, 633,250, or 24%; other Christians, 179,875, or 7%;
and Moslems, 1,828,875, or 69%); and in the seven Armenian
kazas the population was 282,375 (Armenians, 184,875, or 65%;
other Christians, 1000, or 0.3%; and Moslems, 96,500, or 34.7%).
In 1897 there were 970,656 Armenians in Russia, of whom
827,634 were in the provinces of Erivan, Elisavetpol and Tiflis.</p>

<p>The total number of Armenians is estimated at 2,900,000 (in
Turkey, 1,500,000; Russia, 1,000,000; Persia, 150,000; Europe,
America and East Indies, 250,000).</p>

<p><i>History</i>.&mdash;The history of Armenia has been largely influenced
by its physical features. The isolation of the valleys, especially
in winter, encouraged a tendency to separation, which invariably
showed itself when the central power was weak. The rugged
mountains have always been the home of hardy mountaineers
impatient of control, and the sanctuary to which the lowlanders
fled for safety in times of invasion. The country stands as an
open doorway between the East and the West. Through its long
valleys run the roads that connect the Iranian plateau with the
fertile lands and protected harbours of Asia Minor, and for its
possession nations have contended from the remotest past.</p>

<p>The original inhabitants of Armenia are unknown, but, about
the middle of the 9th century <span class="scs">B.C.</span>, the mass of the people belonged
to that great family of tribes which seems to have been
spread over western Asia and to have had a common
<span class="sidenote">Ethnology.</span>
non-Aryan language. Mixed with these proto-Armenians, there
was an important Semitic element of Assyrian and Hebrew
origin. In the 7th century <span class="scs">B.C.</span>, between 640 and 600, the country
was conquered by an Aryan people, who imposed their language,
and possibly their name, upon the vanquished, and formed a
military aristocracy that was constantly recruited from Persia
and Parthia. Politically the two races soon amalgamated, but,
except in the towns, there was apparently little intermarriage,
for the peasants in certain districts closely resemble the proto-Armenians,
as depicted on their monuments. After the Arab
and Seljuk invasions, there was a large emigration of Aryan and
Semitic Armenians to Constantinople and Cilicia; and all that
remained of the aristocracy was swept away by the Mongols and
Tatars. This perhaps explains the diversity of type and characteristics
amongst the modern Armenians. In the recesses of
Mount Taurus the peasants are tall, handsome, though somewhat
sharp-featured, agile and brave. In Armenia and Asia Minor
they are robust, thick-set and coarse-featured, with straight black
hair and large hooked noses. They are good cultivators of the
soil, but are poor, superstitious, ignorant and unambitious, and
they live in semi-subterranean houses as their ancestors did 800
years <span class="scs">B.C.</span> The townsmen, especially in the large towns, have
more regular features&mdash;often of the Persian type. They are
skilled artisans, bankers and merchants, and are remarkable for
their industry, their quick intelligence, their aptitude for
business, and for that enterprising spirit which led their ancestors,
in Roman times, to trade with Scythia, China and India. The
upper classes are polished and well educated, and many have
occupied high positions in the public service in Turkey, Russia,
Persia and Egypt. The Armenians are essentially an Oriental
people, possessing, like the Jews, whom they resemble in their
exclusiveness and widespread dispersion, a remarkable tenacity
of race and faculty of adaptation to circumstances. They are
frugal, sober, industrious and intelligent, and their sturdiness of
character has enabled them to preserve their nationality and
religion under the sorest trials. They are strongly attached to
old manners and customs, but have also a real desire for progress
which is full of promise. On the other hand they are greedy of
gain, quarrelsome in small matters, self-seeking and wanting in
stability; and they are gifted with a tendency to exaggeration
and a love of intrigue which has had an unfortunate influence
on their history. They are deeply separated by religious
differences, and their mutual jealousies, their inordinate vanity
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page565" id="page565"></a>565</span>
their versatility and their cosmopolitan character must always
be an obstacle to the realization of the dreams of the nationalists.
The want of courage and self-reliance, the deficiency in truth and
honesty sometimes noticed in connexion with them, are doubtless
due to long servitude under an unsympathetic government.</p>

<div class="center pt2"><img style="width:1062px; height:794px" src="images/img565.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p class="pt2">The early history of Armenia, more or less mythical, is partly
based on traditions of the Biainian kings (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Ararat</a></span>), and is
interwoven with the Bible narrative, of which a knowledge
was possibly obtained from captive Jews settled
<span class="sidenote">Ancient kingdom.</span>
in the country by Assyrian and Babylonian monarchs.
The legendary kings are but faint echoes of the kings of Biainas;
the story of Semiramis and Ara is but another form of the myth
of Venus and Adonis; and tradition has clothed Tigranes, the
reputed friend of Cyrus, with the transient glory of the opponent
of Lucullus. The fall of the Biainian kingdom, perhaps overthrown
by Cyaxares, was apparently soon followed by an immigration
of Aryan (Medo-Persian) races, including the progenitors
of the Armenians. But they spread slowly, for the &ldquo;Ten
Thousand,&rdquo; when crossing the plateau to Trebizond, 401-400 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>,
met no Armenians after leaving the villages four days&rsquo; march
beyond the Teleboas, now Kara Su.  Under the Medes and
Persians Armenia was a satrapy governed by a member of the
reigning family; and after the battle of Arbela, 331 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>, it was
ruled by Persian governors appointed by Alexander and his
successors. Ardvates, 317-284 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>, freed himself from Seleucid
control; and after the defeat of Antiochus the Great by the
Romans, 190 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>, Artaxias (Ardashes), and Zadriades, the
governors of Armenia Major and Armenia Minor, became independent
kings, with the concurrence of Rome. (See <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Tigranes</a></span>.)
Artaxias established his capital at Artaxata on the Araxes, and
his most celebrated successor was Tigranes (Dikran), 94-56 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>,
the son-in-law of Mithradates VI., the Great. Tigranes founded
a new capital, Tigranocerta, in northern Mesopotamia, which he
modelled on Nineveh and Babylon, and peopled with Greek and
other captives. Here, and at Antioch, he played the part of
&ldquo;great king&rdquo; in Asia until his refusal to surrender his father-in-law
involved him in war with Rome. Defeated, 69 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>, by
Lucullus beneath the walls of his capital, he surrendered his
conquests to Pompey, 66 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>, who had driven Mithradates across
the Phasis, and was permitted to hold Armenia as a vassal state
of Rome.</p>

<p>The campaigns of Lucullus and Pompey brought Rome into
delicate relations with Parthia. Armenia, although politically
dependent upon Rome, was connected with Parthia by
geographical position, a common language and faith,
<span class="sidenote">Under later Empire.</span>
intermarriage and similarity of arms and dress. It had
never been Hellenized, as the provinces of Asia Minor
had been; the Roman provincial system was never applied to it;
and the policy of Rome towards it was never consistent. The
country became the field upon which the East and West contended
for mastery, and the struggle ended for a time in the partition
of Armenia, <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 387, between Rome and Persia. The Roman
portion was soon added to the Diocesis Pontica. The Persian
portion, Pers-Armenia, remained a vassal state under an Arsacid
prince until 428. It was afterwards governed by Persian and
Armenian noblemen selected by the &ldquo;great king,&rdquo; and entitled
<i>marzbans</i>. Before the partition, Tiridates, converted by St
Gregory, &ldquo;the Illuminator,&rdquo; had established Christianity as the
religion of the state, and set an example followed later by Constantine.
After the partition, the invention of the Armenian
alphabet, and the translation of the Bible into the vernacular,
410, drew the Armenians together, and the discontinuance of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page566" id="page566"></a>566</span>
Greek in the Holy Offices relaxed the ecclesiastical dependence on
Constantinople, which ceased entirely when the Patriarch, 491,
refused to accept the decrees of the council of Chalcedon. The
rule of the <i>marzbans</i> was marked by relentless persecution of the
Christians, forced conversions to Magism, frequent insurrections
and the rise to importance of the great families founded by men
of Assyrian, Parthian, Persian, Syrian and Jewish origin, and in
some cases of royal blood, who had been governors of districts, or
holders of fiefs under the Arsacids. Amongst the <i>marzbans</i> were
Jewish Bagratids and Persian Mamegonians; and one of the
latter family, Vartan, made himself independent (571-578), with
Byzantine aid. In 632 the victories of Heraclius restored Armenia
to the Byzantines; but the war that followed the Arab invasion,
636, left the country in the hands of the caliphs, who set over it
Arab and Armenian governors (<i>ostikans</i>). One of the governors,
the Bagratid Ashod I., was crowned king of Armenia by the
caliph Motamid, 885, and founded a dynasty which ended with
Kagig II. in 1079. A little later the Ardzrunian Kagig, governor
of Vaspuragan or Van, was crowned king of that province
by the caliph Moktadir, 908, and his descendants ruled at Van
and Sivas until 1080. The Bagratids founded dynasties at Kars,
962-1080, and in Georgia, which they held until its absorption,
1801, by Russia. From 984 to 1085 the country from Diarbekr
to Melasgerd was ruled under the suzerainty first of Arabs then
of Byzantines and Seljuks, by the Mervanid dynasty of Kurds,
called princes of Abahuni (<span class="grk" title="Apachouvaes">&#7944;&#960;&#945;&#967;&#959;&#965;&#957;&#8134;&#962;</span>). The Arab invasion drove
many Armenian noblemen to Constantinople, where they intermarried
with the old Roman families or became soldiers of fortune.
Artavasdes, an Arsacid, usurped the Byzantine throne for
two years; Leo V., an Ardzrunian, and John Zimisces, became
emperors; whilst Manuel, the Mamegonian, and others were
amongst the best generals of the empire. In 991, and again in
1021, Basil II. invaded Armenia, and in the latter year Senekherim,
king of Vaspuragan, exchanged his kingdom for Sivas
and its territory, where he settled down with many Armenian
emigrants. Basil&rsquo;s policy was to make the great Armenian
fortresses, garrisoned by imperial troops, the first line of defence
on his eastern frontier; but it failed in the hands of his feeble
successors, who thought more of converting heretical Armenia
than of defending its frontier. The king of Ani, Kagig II., was
compelled to exchange his kingdom for estates in Cappadocia.
The country was raided by Seljuks and harried by Byzantine
soldiers, and the miseries of the people were regarded as
gain to the Orthodox church. After the defeat and capture of
Romanus IV. by Alp Arslan, 1071, Armenia formed part of the
Seljuk empire until it split up, 1157, into petty states, ruled by
Arabs, Kurds and Seljuks, who were in turn swept away by the
Mongol invasion, 1235. For more than three centuries after the
appearance of the Seljuks, Armenia was traversed by a long
<span class="sidenote">Medieval Partition.</span>
succession of nomad tribes whose one aim was to secure
good pasturage for their flocks on their way to the
richer lands of Asia Minor. The cultivators were driven
from the plains, agriculture was destroyed, and the country was
seriously impoverished when its ruin was completed by the
ravages and wholesale butcheries of Timur. Many Armenians
fled to the mountains, where they embraced Islam, and intermarried
with the Kurds, or purchased security by paying blackmail
to Kurdish chiefs. Others migrated to Cappadocia or to
Cilicia, where the Bagratid Rhupen had founded, 1080, a small
principality which, gradually extending its limits, became the
kingdom of Lesser Armenia. This Christian kingdom in the
midst of Moslem states, hostile to the Byzantines, giving valuable
support to the leaders of the crusades, and trading with the great
commercial cities of Italy, had a stormy existence of about 300
years. Internal disorders, due to attempts by the later Lusignan
kings to make their subjects conform to the Roman Church,
facilitated its conquest by Egypt, 1375. The memory of Kiligia
(Cilicia) is enshrined in a popular song, and at Zeitun, in the
recesses of Mount Taurus, a small Armenian community has
hitherto maintained almost complete independence. After the
death of Timur, Armenia formed part of the territories of the
Turkoman dynasties of Ak- and Kara-Kuyunli, and under their
milder rule the seat of the Catholicus, which, during the Seljuk
invasion, had been moved first to Sivas, and then to Lesser
Armenia, was re-established, 1441, at Echmiadzin.</p>

<p>In 1514, the Persian campaign of Selim I. gave Armenia to the
Osmanli Turks, and its reorganization was entrusted to Idris, the
historian, who was a Kurd of Bitlis. Idris found the
rich arable lands almost deserted, and the mountains
<span class="sidenote">Under Turkey.</span>
bristling with the castles of independent chieftains, of
Kurd, Arab and Armenian descent, between whom there were
long-standing feuds. He compelled the Kurds to settle on the
vacant lands, and divided the country into small sanjaks which
in the plains were governed by Turkish officials, and in the
mountains by local chiefs. This policy gave rest to the country,
but favoured the growth of Kurd influence and power, which by
1534 had spread westwards to Angora. Armenia was invaded
by the Persians in 1575, and again in 1604, when Shah Abbas
transplanted many thousand Armenians from Julfa to his new
capital Isfahan. In 1639, the province of Erivan, which included
Echmiadzin, was assigned by treaty to Persia, and it remained
in her hands until it passed to Russia, 1828, under the treaty
of Turkman-chai. The Turko-Russian War of 1828-29, which
advanced the Russian frontier to the Arpa Chai, was followed by
a large emigration of Armenians from Turkish to Russian territory,
and a smaller exodus took place after the war of 1877-78,
which gave Batum, Ardahan and Kars to Russia. In 1834
the independent power of the Kurds in Armenia was greatly
curtailed; and risings under Bedr Khan Bey in 1843, and Sheik
Obeidullah in 1880, were firmly suppressed.</p>

<p>After the capture of Constantinople, 1453, Mahommed II.
organized his non-Moslem subjects in communities, or <i>millets</i>,
under ecclesiastical chiefs to whom he gave absolute
authority in civil and religious matters, and in criminal
<span class="sidenote">Gregorian Armenians.</span>
offences that did not come under the Moslem religious
law. Under this system the Armenian bishop of Brusa,
who was appointed patriarch of Constantinople by the sultan,
became the civil, and practically the ecclesiastical head of his
community (<i>Ermeni millet</i>), and a recognized officer of the
imperial government with the rank of vizier. He was assisted
by a council of bishops and clergy, and was represented in each
province by a bishop. This <i>imperium in imperio</i> secured to the
Armenians a recognized position before the law, the free enjoyment
of their religion, the possession of their churches and
monasteries, and the right to educate their children and manage
their municipal affairs. It also encouraged the growth of a
community life, which eventually gave birth to an intense
longing for national life. On the other hand it degraded the
priesthood. The priests became political leaders rather than
spiritual guides, and sought promotion by bribery and intrigue.
Education was neglected and discouraged, servility and treachery
were developed, and in less than a century the people had become
depraved and degraded to an almost incredible extent. After the
issue, 1839, of the <i>hatt-i-skerif</i> of Gül-khaneh, the tradesmen
and artisans of the capital freed themselves from clerical control.
Under regulations, approved by the sultan in 1862, the patriarch
remained the official representative of the community, but all
real power passed into the hands of clerical and lay councils
elected by a representative assembly of 140 members. The
&ldquo;community,&rdquo; which excluded Roman Catholics and Protestants,
was soon called the &ldquo;nation,&rdquo; &ldquo;domestic&rdquo; became &ldquo;national&rdquo;
affairs, and the &ldquo;representative&rdquo; the &ldquo;national&rdquo; assembly.</p>

<p>The connexion of &ldquo;Lesser Armenia&rdquo; with the Western powers
led to the formation, 1335, of an Armenian fraternity, &ldquo;the
Unionists,&rdquo; which adopted the dogmas of the Roman
church, and at the council of Florence, 1439, was
<span class="sidenote">Roman Catholics.</span>
entitled the &ldquo;United Armenian Church.&rdquo; Under the
millet system the unionists were frequently persecuted by the
patriarchs, but this ended in 1830, when, at the intervention of
France, they were made a community (<i>Katoluk millet</i>), with their
own ecclesiastical head. The Roman Catholics, through the works
issued by the Mechitharists at Venice, have greatly promoted the
progress of education and the development of Armenian literature.
They are most numerous at Constantinople, Angora and Smyrna.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page567" id="page567"></a>567</span></p>

<p>The Protestant movement, initiated at Constantinople by
American missionaries in 1831, was opposed by the patriarchs
and Russia. In 1846 the patriarch anathematized all
Armenians with Protestant sympathies, and this led
<span class="sidenote">Protestants.</span>
to the formation of the &ldquo;Evangelical Church of the
Armenians,&rdquo; which was made, after much opposition from France
and Russia, a community (<i>Protestant millet</i>), at the instance of the
British ambassador. The missionaries afterwards founded colleges
on the Bosporus, at Kharput, Marsivan and Aintab, to supply
the needs of higher university education, and they opened good
schools for both sexes at all their stations. Everywhere they
supplied the people with pure, wholesome literature, and represented
progress and religious liberty.</p>

<p>When Abd-ul-Hamid came to the throne of Turkey in 1876, the
condition of the Armenians was better than it had ever been under
the Osmanlis; but with the close of the war of 1877-78
came the &ldquo;Armenian Question.&rdquo; By the treaty of San
<span class="sidenote">Modern Armenian question.</span>
Stefano, Turkey engaged to Russia to carry out reforms
&ldquo;in the provinces inhabited by the Armenians, and
to guarantee their security against the Kurds and Circassians.&rdquo;
By the treaty of Berlin, 13th of July 1878, a like engagement to the
six signatory powers was substituted for that to Russia. By the
Cyprus convention, 4th of June 1878, the sultan promised Great
Britain to introduce necessary reforms &ldquo;for the protection of the
Christians and other subjects of the Porte&rdquo; in the Turkish
territories in Asia. The Berlin treaty encouraged the Armenians
to look to the powers, and not to Russia for protection; and the
convention, which did not mention the Armenians, was regarded
as placing them under the special protection of Great Britain.
This impression was strengthened by the action of England at
Berlin in insisting that Russia should evacuate the occupied
territory before reforms were introduced, and so removing the
only security for their introduction. The presentation of identic
and collective notes to the Porte by the powers, in 1880, produced
no result, and in 1882 it was apparent that Turkey would only
yield to compulsion. In 1881 a circular note from the British
ministry to the five powers was evasively answered, and in 1883
Prince Bismarck intimated to the British government that
Germany cared nothing about Armenian reforms and that the
matter had better be allowed to drop. Russia had changed her
policy towards the Armenians, and the other powers were
indifferent. The so-called &ldquo;Concert of Europe&rdquo; was at an end,
but British ministries continued to call the attention of the
sultan to his obligations under the treaty of Berlin.</p>

<p>Russia began to interest herself in the Armenians when she
acquired Georgia in 1801; but it was not until 1828-1829 that
any appreciable number of them became her subjects.
She found them necessary to the development of her
<span class="sidenote">Russian policy.</span>
new territories, and allowed them much freedom.
They were permitted, within certain limits, to develop their
national life; many became wealthy, and many rose to high
positions in the military and civil service of the state. After the
war of 1877-78 the Russian consuls in Turkey encouraged the
formation of patriotic committees in Armenia, and a project was
formed to create a separate state, under the supremacy of Russia,
which was to include Russian, Persian and Turkish Armenia.
The project was favoured by Loris-Melikov, then all-powerful in
Russia, but in 1881 Alexander II. was assassinated, and shortly
afterwards a strongly anti-Armenian policy was adopted. The
schools were closed, the use of the Armenian language was discouraged,
and attempts were made to Russify the Armenians and
bring them within the pale of the Russian Church. All hope of
practical self-government under Russian protection now ceased,
and the Armenians of Tiflis turned their attention to Turkish
Armenia. They had seen the success of the Slav committees
in treating disturbances in the Balkans, and became the moving
spirit in the attempts to produce similar troubles in Armenia.
Russia made no real effort to check the action of her Armenian
subjects, and after 1884 she steadily opposed any active interference
by Great Britain in favour of the Turkish Armenians.
When Echmiadzin passed to Russia, in 1828, the Catholicus began
to claim spiritual jurisdiction over the whole Armenian Church,
and the submission of the patriarch of Constantinople was
obtained by Russia when she helped the sultan against
Mehemet Ali. Subsequently Russia secured the submission of
the independent catholicus of Sis, and thus acquired a power of
interference in Armenian affairs in all parts of the world. During
1900 Russia showed renewed interest in Turkish Armenia by
securing the right to construct all railways in it, and in the
Armenians by pressing the Porte to restore order and introduce
reforms.</p>

<p>The Berlin treaty was a disappointment to the Gregorian
Armenians, who had hoped that Armenia and Cilicia would have
been formed into an autonomous province administered by
Christians. But the formation of such a province was impossible.
The Gregorians were scattered over the empire, and, except in a
few small districts, were nowhere in a majority. Nor were they
bound together by any community of thought or sentiment.
The Turkish-speaking Armenians of the south could scarcely
converse with the Armenian-speaking people of the north; and
the ignorant mountaineers of the east had nothing in common,
<span class="sidenote">Revolutionary movement.</span>
except religion, with the highly educated townsmen
of Constantinople and Smyrna. After the change in
Russian policy and the failure of the powers to secure
reforms, the advanced party amongst the Armenians,
some of whom had been educated in Europe and been deeply
affected by the free thought and Nihilistic tendencies of the day,
determined to secure their object by the production of disturbances
such as those that had given birth to Bulgaria. Societies
were formed at Tiflis and in several European capitals for the
circulation of pamphlets and newspapers, and secret societies,
such as the Huntchagist, were instituted for more revolutionary
methods. An active propaganda was carried on in Turkish
Armenia by emissaries, who tried to introduce arms and explosives,
and represented the ordinary incidents of Turkish misrule
to Europe as serious atrocities. The revolutionary movement
was joined by some of the younger men, who formed local
committees on the Nihilist plan, but it was strongly opposed
by the Armenian clergy and the American missionaries, who saw
the impossibility of success; and its irreligious tendency and the
self-seeking ambition of its leaders made it unacceptable to the
mass of the people. Exasperated at their failure, the emissaries
organized attacks on individuals, wrote threatening letters, and
at last posted revolutionary placards, 5th of January 1893, at
Yuzgat, and on the walls of the American College at Marsivan. In
the last case the object of the Huntchagists was to compromise
the missionaries, and in this they succeeded. The Americans were
accused of issuing the placards; two Armenian professors were
imprisoned; and the girls&rsquo; school was burned down. Outbreaks,
easily suppressed, followed at Kaisarieh and other places.</p>

<p>One of the revolutionary dreams was to make the ancient
Daron the centre of a new Armenia. But the movement met with
no encouragement, either amongst the prosperous peasants on the
rich plain of Mush or in the mountain villages of Sasun. In the
summer of 1893, an emissary was captured near Mush, and the
governor, hoping to secure others, ordered the Kurdish Irregular
Horse to raid the mountain district. The Armenians drove off
the Kurds,<a name="fa1n" id="fa1n" href="#ft1n"><span class="sp">1</span></a> and, when attacked in the spring of 1894, again held
their own. The vali now called up regular troops from Erzingan;
and the sultan issued a firman calling upon all loyal subjects
to aid in suppressing the revolt. A massacre of a most brutal
character, in which Turkish soldiers took part, followed; and
aroused deep indignation in Europe. In November 1894 a
Turkish commission of inquiry was sent to Armenia, and was
accompanied by the consular delegates of Great Britain, France
and Russia, who elicited the fact that there had been no attempt
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page568" id="page568"></a>568</span>
at revolt to justify the action of the authorities. Throughout
1894 the state of the country bordered upon anarchy, and
during the winter of 1894-1895 the British government, with
lukewarm support from France and Russia, pressed for administrative
reforms in the vilayets of Erzerum, Van, Bitlis, Sivas,
Memuret-el-Aziz (Kharput) and Diarbekr. The Porte made
counter-proposals, and officials concerned in the Sasun massacres
were decorated and rewarded. On the 11th of May 1895 the
three powers presented to the sultan a complicated scheme of
reforms which was more calculated to increase than to lessen
the difficulties connected with the government of Armenia; but
it was the only one to which Russia would agree. The sultan
delayed his answer. Great Britain was in favour of coercion, but
Russia, when sounded, replied that she &ldquo;would certainly not
join in any coercive measures&rdquo; and she was supported by France.
At this moment, 21st of June 1895, Lord Rosebery&rsquo;s cabinet
resigned, and when Lord Salisbury&rsquo;s government resumed the
negotiations in August, the sultan appealed to France and Russia
against England. During the negotiations the secret societies had
not been inactive. Disturbances occurred at Tarsus; Armenians
who did not espouse the &ldquo;national&rdquo; cause were murdered; the
life of the patriarch was threatened; and a report was circulated
that the British ambassador wished some Armenians killed
to give him an excuse for bringing the fleet to Constantinople.
On the 1st of October 1895 a number of Armenians, some armed,
went in procession with a petition to the Porte and were ordered
by the police to disperse. Shots were fired, and a riot occurred
in which many Armenian and some Moslem lives were lost. The
British ambassador now pressed the scheme of reforms upon the
sultan, who accepted it on the 17th of October. Meanwhile there
had been a massacre at Trebizond (October 8), in which armed
men from Constantinople took part, and it had become evident
that no united action on the part of the powers was to be feared.
The sultan refused to publish the scheme of reforms, and massacre
followed massacre in Armenia in quick succession until the 1st
of January 1896. Nothing was done. Russia refused to agree
to any measure of coercion, and declared (December 19)
that she would take no action except such as was needed for
the protection of foreigners. Great Britain was not prepared
to act alone. In the summer of 1896 (June 14-22) there
were massacres at Van, Egin, and Niksar; and on the 26th of
August the Imperial Ottoman Bank at Constantinople was
seized by revolutionists as a demonstration against the Christian
powers who had left the Armenians to their fate. The project
was known to the Porte, and the rabble, previously armed
and instructed, were at once turned loose in the streets. Two
days&rsquo; massacre followed, during which from 6000 to 7000
Gregorian Armenians perished.</p>

<p>The massacres were apparently organized and carried out in
accordance with a well-considered plan. They occurred, except
in six places, in the vilayets to which the scheme of
reforms was to apply. At Trebizond they took place
<span class="sidenote">The massacres.</span>
just before the sultan accepted that scheme, and after
his acceptance of it they spread rapidly. They were confined
to Gregorian and Protestant Armenians. The Roman Catholics
were protected by France, the Greek Christians by Russia. The
massacre of Syrians, Jacobites and Chaldees at Urfa and elsewhere
formed no part of the original plan. Orders were given
to protect foreigners, and in some cases guards were placed over
their houses. The damage to the American buildings at Kharput
was due to direct disobedience of orders. The attacks on the
bazars were made without warning, during business hours, when
the men were in their shops and the women in their houses.
Explicit promises were given, in some instances, that there would
be no danger to those who opened their shops, but they were
deliberately broken. Nearly all those who, from their wealth,
education and influence, would have had a share in the government
under the scheme of reforms, were killed and their families
ruined by the destruction of their property. Where any attempt
at defence was made the slaughter was greatest. The only
successful resistance was at Zeitun, where the people received
honourable terms after three months&rsquo; fighting. In some towns
the troops and police took an active part in the massacres. At
Kharput artillery was used. In some the slaughter commenced
and ended by bugle-call, and in a few instances the Armenians
were disarmed beforehand. Wherever a superior official or army
officer intervened the massacre at once ceased, and wherever
a governor stood firm there was no disturbance. The actual
perpetrators of the massacres were the local Moslems, aided by
Lazis, Kurds and Circassians. A large majority of the Moslems
disapproved of the massacres, and many Armenians were saved
by Moslem friends. But the lower orders were excited by reports
that the Armenians, supported by the European powers, were
plotting the overthrow of the sultan; and their cupidity was
aroused by the prospect of wiping out their heavy debts to
Armenian pedlars and merchants. No one was punished for the
massacres, and many of those implicated in them were rewarded.
In some districts, especially in the Kharput vilayet, the cry of
&ldquo;Islam or death&rdquo; was raised. Gregorian priests and Protestant
pastors were tortured, but preferred death to apostasy. Men and
women were killed in prison and in churches in cold blood.
Churches, monasteries, schools and houses were plundered and
destroyed. In some places there was evidence of the previous
activity of secret societies, in others none. The number of those
who perished, excluding Constantinople, was 20,000 to 25,000.<a name="fa2n" id="fa2n" href="#ft2n"><span class="sp">2</span></a>
Many were forced to embrace Islam, and numbers were reduced
to poverty. The destruction of property was enormous, the
hardest-working and best tax-paying element in the country was
destroyed, or impoverished, and where the breadwinners were
killed the women and children were left destitute. Efforts by
Great Britain and the United States to alleviate the distress were
opposed by the authorities, but met with some success. After
the massacres the number of students in the American schools
and colleges increased, and many Gregorian Armenians became
Roman Catholics in order to obtain the protection of France.</p>

<p>The Armenian revolutionary societies continued their propaganda
down to the granting of the Turkish constitution in
1908; and meanwhile further massacres occurred here and there,
notably at Mush (1904) and Van (1908).</p>

<p><a name="ft1n" id="ft1n" href="#fa1n"><span class="fn">1</span></a> The Armenians and Kurds have lived together from the earliest
times. The adoption of Islam by the latter, and by many Armenians,
divided the people sharply into Christian and Moslem, and placed the
Christian in a position of inferiority. But the relations between the
two sects were not unfriendly previously to the Russian campaigns
in Persia and Turkey. After 1829 the relations became less friendly;
and later, when the Armenians attracted the sympathies of the
European powers after the war of 1877-78, they became bitterly
hostile.</p>

<p><span class="bold">ARMENIAN CHURCH<a name="ar134" id="ar134"></a></span>. No trustworthy account exists of
the evangelization of Armenia, for the legend of King Abgar&rsquo;s
correspondence with Christ, even if it contained any historical
truth, only relates to Edessa and Syriac Christianity. That the
Armenians appropriated from the Syrians this, as well as the
stories of Bartholomew and Thaddeus (the Syriac <i>Addai</i>), was
merely an avowal on their part that Edessa was the centre from
which the faith radiated over their land. In the 4th century and
later the liturgy was still read in Syriac in parts of Armenia,
and the New Testament, the history of Eusebius, the homilies of
Aphraates, the works of St Ephraem and many other early
books were translated from Syriac, from which tongue most
of their ecclesiological terms were derived. The earliest notice
of an organized church in Armenia is in Eusebius, <i>H. E</i>. vi. 46,
to the effect that Dionysius of Alexandria <i>c</i>. 250 sent a letter to
Meruzanes, bishop of the brethren in Armenia. There were many
Christians in Melitene at the time of the Decian persecution in
<span class="scs">A.D.</span> 250, and two bishops from Great Armenia were present at the
council of Nice in 325. King Tiridates (<i>c</i>. <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 238-314) had
already been baptized some time after 261 by Gregory the
Illuminator. The latter was ordained priest and appointed
<i>catholicus</i> or exarch of the church of Great Armenia by Leontius,
bishop of Caesarea in Cappadocia. This one fact is certain amidst
the fables which soon obscured the history of this great missionary.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page569" id="page569"></a>569</span>
Thus the church of Great Armenia began as a province of the
Cappadocian see. But there was a tradition of a line of bishops
earlier than Gregory in Siuniq, a region east of Ararat along the
Araxes (Aras), which in early times claimed to be independent
of the catholicus. The Adoptianist bishop Archelaus, who
opposed the entry of Mani into Armenia under Probus <i>c</i>. 277, was
also perhaps a Syriac-speaking bishop of Pers-Armenia. Almost
the earliest document revealing anything of the inner organization
and condition of the Armenian church in the Nicene age is
the epistle of Macarius, bishop of Jerusalem, to the Armenian
bishop Verthanes, written between 325 and 335 and preserved
in Armenian. Its genuineness has been unreasonably suspected.
It insists on the erection of fonts; on distinction of grades
among the ordained clergy; on not postponing baptism too
long; on bishops and priests alone, and not deacons, being
allowed to baptize and lay hands on or confirm the baptized;
on avoiding communion with Arians; on the use of unleavened
bread in the Sacrament, &amp;c. We learn from it that the bishop
of Basen and Bagrevand was an Arian at that time. By the year
450 these two districts already had separate bishops of their own.
The letter of Macarius, therefore, if a forgery, must be a very
early one.<a name="fa1o" id="fa1o" href="#ft1o"><span class="sp">1</span></a> The Armenians must, like the Georgians a little
later, have set store by the opinion of the bishop of Jerusalem,
or they would not have sent to consult him. It was equally from
Jerusalem that they subsequently adopted their lectionary and
arrangement of the Christian year; and a 9th-century copy
of this lectionary in the Paris library preserves to us precious
details of the liturgical usages of Jerusalem in the 4th century.
We can trace the presence of Armenian convents on the Mount
of Olives as early as the 5th century.</p>

<p>Tradition represents the conversion of Great Armenia under
Gregory and Tiridates as a sort of triumphant march, in which
the temples of the demons and their records were destroyed
wholesale, and their undefended sites instantly converted into
Christian churches. The questions arise: how was the transition
from old to new effected? and what was the type of
teaching dominant in the new church? Armenian tradition,
confirmed by nearly contemporary Greek sources, answers the
first question. The old order went on, but under new names.
The priestly families, we learn, hearing that the God preached by
Gregory needed not sacrifice, sent to the king a deputation and
asked how they were to live, if they became Christians; for until
then the priests and their families had lived off the portions
of the animal victims and other offerings reserved to them by
pagan custom. Gregory replied that, if they would join the new
religion, not only should the sacrifices continue, but they should
have larger perquisites then ever. The priestly families then
went over <i>en masse</i>. How far the older sacrificial rules resembled
the levitical law we do not know, but in the canons of Sahak,
<i>c</i>. 430, the priests already receive the levitical portions of the
victims; and we find that animals are being sacrificed every
Sunday, on the feast days which at first were few, in fulfilment
of private vows, in expiation of the sins of the living, and still
more of those of the dead. No one might kill his own meat and
deprive the priest of his due; but this rule did not apply to the
chase. The earliest Armenian rituals contain ample services for
the conduct of an <i>agap&#275;</i> (<i>q.v.</i>) or love feast held in the church off
sacrificial meat. The victim was slaughtered by the priest in
the church porch before the crucifix, after it had been ritually
wreathed and given the holy salt, by licking which it appropriated
a sacramental purity or efficacy previously conveyed into the
salt by exorcisms and consecration. In the canons of Sahak the
priest is represented as eating the sins of the people in these repasts.</p>

<p>It is easy to underrate the importance in religion of a change
of names. The old sacrificial hymns were probably obscene
and certainly nonsensical, and the substitution for them of the
psalms, and of lections of the prophets and New Testament, was
an enormous gain. We do not know precisely how the eucharistic
rite was adjusted to these sacrificial meals; but, in the
canons of Sahak, 1 Cor. xi. 17-34 is interpreted of these meals,
which were known as the Dominical (suppers). The Eucharist
was, therefore, long associated with the <i>matal</i> or animal victim,
and only in the 8th century do we hear of an interval of time being
left between the fleshly and the spiritual sacrifices, as the two
rites were then called. The Basilian service of the Eucharist
was used in the 5th century, but superseded later on by a
Byzantine rite which will be found translated in F.E. Brightman&rsquo;s
<i>Eastern Liturgies</i>. The Eucharist was no doubt the one
important sacrifice in the minds of the clergy who had attended
the schools of Constantinople and Alexandria; yet the heart of
the people remained in their ancient blood-offerings, and as late
as the 12th century they were prone to deny that the mass could
expiate the sins of the dead unless accompanied by the sacrifice
of an animal. Perhaps even to-day the worst fate that can befall
a villager after death is to be deprived, not of commemoration
in the mass, but of the victim slain for his sins. The keenest
spiritual weapon of the Armenian priest was ever a threat not to
offer the <i>matal</i> for a man when he died.</p>

<p>Another survival in the Armenian church was the hereditary
priesthood. None but a scion of a priestly family could become
a deacon, elder or bishop. Accordingly the primacy remained
in the family of Gregory until about 374, when the king Pap
or Bab murdered Nerses, who had been ordained by Eusebius
of Caesarea (362-370) and was over-zealous in implanting in
Armenia the canons about celibacy, marriage, fasting, hospices
and monastic life which Basil had established in Cappadocia.
It may be remarked that Gregory&rsquo;s own family was a cadet
branch of the Arsacid kin which had occupied the thrones of
Persia, Bactria, Armenia and Georgia. His primacy therefore
was in itself a survival of an earlier age when king and priest
were one. He was in fact a <i>rex sacrificulus</i>, and later on, when
the Arsacid dynasty fell in Armenia <i>c</i>. <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 428, the Armenian
catholicus became the symbol of national unity and the rallying-point
of patriotism. The line of Gregory was restored in 390 in
the person of Isaac or Sahak, son of Nerses, and his patriarchate
was the golden age of Armenian literature. But by this time the
autonomy of the Armenian church was thoroughly established.
On the death of Nerses the right of saying grace at the royal
meals, which was the essence of the catholicate, was transferred by
the king, in despite of the Greeks, to the priestly family of Albianus,
and thenceforth no Armenian catholicus went to Caesarea for
ordination. The ties with Greek official Christendom were
snapped for ever, and in subsequent ages the doctrinal preferences
of the Armenians were usually determined more by antagonism
to the Greeks than by reflection. If they accepted the council
of Ephesus in 430 and joined in the condemnation of Nestorius,
it was rather because the Sassanid kings of Persia, who thirsted
for the reconquest of Armenia, favoured Nestorianism, a form of
doctrine current in Persia and rejected in Byzantium. But later
on, about 480, and throughout the following centuries, the
Armenians rejected the decrees of Chalcedon and held that the
assertion of two natures in Christ was a relapse into the heresy of
Nestor. From the close of the 5th century the Armenians have
remained monophysite, like the Copts and Abyssinians, and have
only broken the record with occasional short interludes of orthodoxy,
as when in 633 the emperor Heraclius forced reunion on
them, under a catholicus named Esdras, at a council held in
Erzerum. Even then all parties were careful not to mention
Chalcedon. The march of Arab conquest kept the Armenians
friendly to Byzantium for a few years; but in 718 the catholicus
John of Odsun ascended the throne and at the council of Manazkert
in 728 repeated and confirmed the anathemas against
Chalcedon and the tome of Leo, that had been first pronounced by
the catholicus Babken in 491 at a synod held in Valarshapat by
the united Armenian, Georgian or Iberian, and Albanian churches.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page570" id="page570"></a>570</span>
The Armenians marked their complete disruption with the Greeks
by starting an era of their own at the synod of Dvin. The era
began on the 11th of July 552, and their year is vague, that is to
say, it does not intercalate a day in February every fourth year,
like the Julian calendar.</p>

<p>The two churches of Iberia and Albania at first depended on
the Armenian for ordination of their primates or <i>catholici</i>, and in
large part owed their first constitution to Armenian missionaries
sent by Gregory the Illuminator. The Iberians still reverence
as saints the Armenian doctors of the 5th century, but as early
as 552 they began to resent the dictatorial methods of the
Armenians, as well might a proud race of mountaineers who
never wholly lost their political independence; and they broke
off their allegiance to the Armenian see very soon afterwards,
accepted Chalcedon and joined the Byzantine church. The
Albanians of the Caucasus were also converted in the age of
Gregory, early in the 4th century, and were loyal to the
Armenians in the great struggle against Mazdaism in the 5th;
but broke away for a time towards 600, and chose a patriarch
without sending him to Armenia for ordination. Eventually
this interesting church was engulfed by the rising tide of
Mahommedan conquest, but not before one of their bishops,
named Israel, had converted (677-703) the Huns who lay to the
north of the Caspian and had translated the Bible and liturgies
into their language. If the Albanian and Hunnish versions could
be found, they would be of the greatest linguistic importance.</p>

<p>The mother church of Armenia was established by Gregory at
Ashtishat in the province of Taron, on the site of the great temple
of Wahagn, whose festival on the seventh of the month Sahmi
was reconsecrated to John the Baptist and Athenogenes, an
Armenian martyr and Greek hymn writer. The first of Navasard,
the Armenian new year&rsquo;s day, was the feast of a god Vanatur
or Wanadur (who answered to <span class="grk" title="Zeus xenios">&#918;&#949;&#8058;&#962; &#958;&#941;&#957;&#953;&#959;&#962;</span>) in the holy pilgrim
city of Bagawan. His day was reconsecrated to the Baptist,
whose relics were brought to Bagawan. The feast of Anahite,
the Armenian Venus and spouse of the chief god Aramazd, was
in the same way rededicated to the Virgin Mary, who for long was
not very clearly distinguished by the Armenians from the virgin
mother church. The old cult of sacred stones and trees by an
easy transition became cross-worship, but a cross was not sacred
until the Christ had been, by priestly prayer and invocation,
transferred into it.</p>

<p>What was the earliest doctrine of the churches of Armenia?
If we could believe the fathers of the 5th and succeeding centuries
Nicene orthodoxy prevailed in their country from the first;
and in the 5th century they certainly chose for translation the
works of orthodox fathers alone, such as Chrysostom, Basil,
Gregory of Nyssa and Gregory Nazianzen, Cyril of Jerusalem and
Cyril of Alexandria, Athanasius, Julius of Rome, Hippolytus,
Irenaeus, avoiding Origen and other fathers who were becoming
suspect. However, we do hear of versions of Nestorian writers
like Diodore of Tarsus being in circulation, and the <i>Disputation</i> of
Archelaus proves that the current orthodoxy of eastern Armenia
was Adoptianist, if not Ebionite in tone. The Persian Armenians
as late as the 6th century had not heard of the faith of Nicaea,
and only then received it from the catholicus Babken. They sent
a copy of their old creed to Babken, and it closely resembles the
Adoptianist creed of Archelaus, the gist of which was that Jesus,
until his thirtieth year, was a man mortal like other men; then,
because he was righteous above all others, he was promoted to the
honour and name of Son of God. He received the title by grace,
but was not equal to God the Father. Because the Spirit worked
with him, he was able to vanquish Satan and all desires, and
because of his righteousness and good works he was made worthy
of grace and became a Temple of God the Word, which came
down from heaven in Jordan, dwelt in him and through him
wrought miracles. From such a standpoint the baptism of Jesus
was the moment of the divine incarnation. The man righteous
above all others was then reborn of the Spirit, was illuminated,
was spiritually anointed, became the Christ and Son of God. In
effect the fathers of the Armenian church often fell back into such
language, far removed as it is from orthodoxy; and they emphasized
the importance of the baptismal feast of the Epiphany on
the 6th of January by refusing to accept the feast of the physical
birth of the 25th of December. As late as 1165 their patriarch
Nerses defends the Armenian custom of keeping Christmas on
the 6th of January on the express ground that as he was born
after the flesh from the Virgin, <i>so he was born by way of baptism
from the Jordan</i>. The custom from the first, he says, had been
to feast on one and the same day the two births, much as they
differed in sacramental import and in point of time. We see
how deep the early Adoptianism had struck its roots, when a
primate of the 12th century could still appeal to the baptismal
regeneration of Jesus. The same Nerses held that the second
Adam, Jesus Christ, received a new body and nature and the
sevenfold grace of the Spirit <i>in the Jordan</i>. The Armenian
doctors also taught that John by laying hands on Jesus and
ordaining him at his baptism sacramentally transferred to him
the three graces or <i>charismata</i> of kingship, prophecy and priesthood
which had belonged to ancient Israel. After baptism, if
not before, the flesh of Christ was incorruptible. It consisted of
ethereal fire, and he was not subject to the ordinary phenomena
of digestion, secretions and evacuations.</p>

<p>Monastic institutions were hardly introduced in Armenia
before the 5th century, though Christian rest-houses had been
erected along the high-roads long before and are mentioned in
the <i>Disputation</i> of Archelaus. The Armenians called them <i>wanq</i>,
and out of them grew the monasteries. The monks were, strictly
speaking, penitents wearing the cowl, and not allowed to take
a part in church government. This belonged to the elders. At
first there was no separate episcopal ordination, and the one rite
of elder or priest (Armen. <i>Qahanay</i>, Heb. <i>cohen</i>) sufficed. There
were also deacons, half-deacons and readers. Besides these there
was a class of <i>wardapets</i> or teachers, answering to the <i>didascalos</i> of
the earliest church, whose province it was to guard the doctrine
and for whom no rite of ordination is found in the older rituals.</p>

<p>A few other peculiarities of Armenian church usage or belief
deserve notice. In baptism the rubric ordains that the baptized
be plunged three times in the font in commemoration of the
entombment during three days of the Lord. In the West trine
immersion was generally held to be symbolic of the triune name
of &ldquo;Father, Son and Holy Ghost.&rdquo; This name the Armenians
have used, at least since the year 700; before which date their
fathers often speak of baptism into the death of Christ as the
one essential. As late as about 1300 a traveller hostile to the
Armenians reported to the pope that he had witnessed baptisms
without any trinitarian invocation in as many as three hundred
parish churches.</p>

<p>The paschal lamb is now eaten on Sunday, but until the 11th
century, and even later, it was eaten with the Eucharist at a
Lord&rsquo;s Supper celebrated on the evening of Maundy Thursday
after the rite of <i>pedilavium</i> or washing of feet. On the morning
of the same day the penitents were released from their fast.</p>

<p>The rite of extreme unction was introduced in the crusading
epoch, although it was already usual to anoint the bodies of dead
priests. The worship of images never seems to have taken root
among Armenians; indeed they supplied the Greek world with
iconoclast soldiers and emperors. The worship of crosses into
which the Spirit or Christ had been inserted by the priest must
have satisfied the religious needs of a people who, save in architecture,
showed little artistic faculty. In their older rituals we
find a rite for blessing a painted church, but no word of statues.
Frescoes in their churches are rare, and mostly too high up for
veneration to be paid to them.</p>

<p>On certain days the cross was washed, and the water in which
it had been washed was a sovereign charm for curing sickness
in men and animals and for bringing fertility to the land.</p>

<p>In the older rituals we find a rite of <i>exhomologesis</i>, for restoring
those who had sinned after baptism. It was a medicine of sin
that could only be used once and not a second time. In form
it is a rehearsal of the first baptismal rite, but with omission
of the water. It involved like the first rite open confession and
repentance, and absolution by the church. In a later and less
rigorous age this rite was abridged and adjusted to constant
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page571" id="page571"></a>571</span>
repetition, in such wise that a sinner could be restored to grace
not once only, but as often as the clergy chose to accept his
repentance and confession. Thus the whole development of the
penitentiary system is traceable in the MSS.</p>

<p>The confession of a dying man might be taken by any layman
present, and written down in order to be shown to the priest when
he arrived. It then was the duty of the latter to supplicate for
his forgiveness, and administer to him the Eucharist.</p>

<p>The clergy of all grades were originally married. The parish
priests, or white clergy, are so still, except some of the Latinizing
ones. But since the 12th century, or even earlier, the higher
clergy, <i>i.e.</i> patriarchs and bishops, have taken monkish vows and
worn the cowl.</p>

<p>There were abortive attempts to unite the Armenian church
with the Byzantine in the 9th century under the patriarch
Photius, and again late in the 12th under the emperor Manuel
Comnenus, when a joint council met at Romkla, near Tarsus, but
ended in nothing (<span class="scs">A.D.</span> 1179). Neither could the Armenians keep
on good terms even with the Syriac monophysites. From the
age of the crusades on, the Armenians of Cilicia, whose patriarch
sat at Sis, improved their acquaintance with Rome; and more
than one of their patriarchs adopted the Roman faith, at least in
words. Dominican missions went to Armenia, and in 1328 under
their auspices was formed a regular order called the United
Brethren, the forerunners of the Uniats of the present day, who
have convents at Venice and Vienna, a college in Rome and a
numerous following in Turkey. They retain their Armenian
liturgies and rites, pruned to suit the Vatican standards of orthodoxy,
and they recognize the pope as head of the church.</p>

<p>The patriarchs of Great Armenia first resided at Ashtishat,
on the Araxes. From 478 to 931 they occupied Dvin in the same
neighbourhood, then Aghthamar, an island in the Lake of Van,
931-967, the city of Ani, 992-1054, where are still visible the
magnificent ruins of their churches and palaces. Since 1441 the
chief catholicus has sat at Echmiadzin, the convent of Valarshapat,
now part of Russian Armenia. A rival catholicus, with a
small following, still has his cathedral and see at Sis. The catholicus
of Valarshapat is nominally chosen by all Armenians. A
synod of bishops, monks and doctors meets regularly to transact
under his eye the business of the convent and the oecumenical
affairs of the church; but its decisions are subject to the veto of
a Russian procurator. There are Armenian patriarchs, subject
to the spiritual jurisdiction of Echmiadzin, in Constantinople and
Jerusalem. In the latter place the Armenians occupy a convent
on Mount Sion, and keep up in the churches of the Sepulchre and
of Bethlehem their own distinct rites and feasts, the only ones
there which at all resemble those of the 4th century.</p>

<p>The following list of councils was compiled by John, catholicus
about the year 728, and read at the council of Manazkert, when
the dogmatic and disciplinary attitude of the Armenian church
was defined once and for all:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. In twentieth year of catholicate of Gregory and thirty-seventh
of Trdat, the king, on return of Aristaces from council of
Nice, bringing the Nicene creed and canons.</p>

<p>2. Council held by St Nerses on his return from the council of
the 150 fathers at Constantinople against Macedonius.</p>

<p>3. Held by St Sahak and Mesrop on receipt of letters from
Proclus and Cyril after the council of Ephesus, when the &ldquo;Glory
in the Highest&rdquo; was adopted. Held against Nestorianism.</p>

<p>4. Held by Joseph, disciple of Mashdotz (Mesrop) and St Sahak,
in Shahapiwan in the sixth year of King Yazkert (<i>i.e.</i> Yazdegerd)
of Persia, for the regulation of the church. Forty bishops present.
(The Massalians were anathematized.)</p>

<p>5. Held by Babken, catholicus, in the City-plain (<i>i.e.</i> Dvin),
in the 18th year of King Kavat (<i>i.e.</i> Kavadh), against the
heresy of Acacius and Barsuma (Bar-sauma), the friends of
Nestorius. The true (Nicene) faith was sent to the Armenians of
the farther East (shortly afterwards a slightly different creed was
adopted, identical with a pseudo-Athanasian symbol used by
Evagrius of Pontus and given in Greek in Patr. Gr. xxvi. Col.
1232).</p>

<p>6. At the beginning of the Armenian era, held by Nerses in
Dvin, in the fourth year of his catholicate, in the fourteenth of
Chosroes&rsquo; reign and in the fourteenth of Justinian Caesar.
Held against Chalcedon, uniting the Baptism and Christmas
feasts on the 6th of January (Epiphany), declaring for mono-physitism,
and adopting in the <i>Trisagion</i> the words &ldquo;who wast
crucified for us.&rdquo; This settlement lasted for about seventy-four
years.</p>

<p>7. After the retaking of Jerusalem and recovery of the Cross
from the Persians in the eighteenth year of his reign, Heraclius
called a mixed council at Karin (Theodosiopolis) of Greeks and
Armenians under Ezr (Esdras), catholicus, at which the preceding
council of Dvin was cursed, its reforms repudiated and the
confession of Chalcedon adopted. This remained the official
attitude of the Armenian church until the catholicate of Elias
(703-717). John, catholicus, denies to Ezr&rsquo;s meeting the name of
council, and so makes his own the seventh.</p>

<p>8. Under John, catholicus, in Manazkert, in the one hundred
and seventieth year of the Armenian era (= <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 728) under
the presidency of Gregory Asharuni Chorepiscopos (Gregory
Asheruni). All the Armenian bishops attended, as also the
metropolitan of Urhha (Edessa), Jacobite bishops of Gartman,
of Nfrkert, Amasia, by command of the archbishop of Antioch.
Chalcedon was repudiated afresh, union with the Jacobites
instituted, use of water and leaven in the Eucharist condemned,
the five days&rsquo; preliminary fast before Lent restored, Saturday as
well as Sunday made a day of feasting and synaxis, any but the
orthodox excluded from the Maundy Thursday Communion,
the first communion of the new catechumens; union of the
Baptismal and Christmas feasts was restored, and the faithful
forbidden to fast on Fridays from Easter until Pentecost. In
general these rules have been observed in the Armenian church
ever since.</p>

<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">ARMENIAN LANGUAGE AND LITERATURE.<a name="ar135" id="ar135"></a></span>
The Armenian language belongs to the group called Indo-European,
of which the Iranic and Indic tongues formed one
branch, and Greek, Albanian, Italian, Celtic, Germanic
and Baltic-Slavonic dialects the other great branch. Unlike
<span class="sidenote">Language.</span>
most of these, Armenian lost its genders long before the year
<span class="scs">A.D.</span> 400, when the existing literature begins. Modern Persian
similarly has lost gender; and in both cases the liberation must
have been due to attrition of other tongues which had a different
system of gender or none at all. So the Armenians were ever in
contact on the north with the Iberians of the Caucasus who had
none, and with the Semitic races on the south and east which had
other ways of forming genders than the Indo-European tongues.</p>

<p>From the original Armenian stock can be readily distinguished
a mass of Old and Middle Persian loan-words. These are so
numerous that for a time Armenian was classed as an Iranian
tongue. For more than a thousand years, say until <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 640,
Armenia was an appanage of the realm of the Persians and
Parthians. Until <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 428 the Armenian throne was occupied by
a younger branch of the Arsacid dynasty that ruled in Persia
until the advent of the Sassanids (<i>c.</i> <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 226), and the internal
polity and court administration of Armenia were modelled on the
Persian or Parthian. Accordingly over 200 proper and personal
names in Armenia were Old Persian, as well as 700 names of
things. If we count in the derivative forms of these words we
get at least 2000 Old Persian words. Often the same Persian
word was borrowed twice over in an earlier and later form at an
interval of centuries, just as in English we inherit a word direct
or have taken it from Latin, and have also assimilated from
French a later form of the same. The Persian influence in
Armenian was already strong as early as 400 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>, when Xenophon
used a Persian interpreter to converse. In some of the Armenian
villages they answered him in Persian. The Persian loan-words
already present in Armenian as early as <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 400 mirror the
earlier political and social life of Armenia. Thus many of their
kings and nobles had Persian names; Persian also were most
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page572" id="page572"></a>572</span>
words used in connexion with horses and the chase, with war
and army, with dress, trade and coinage, calendar, weights and
measures, with court and political institutions, with music,
medicine, school, education, literature and the arts. Many
everyday words were of the same origin, <i>e.g.</i> the words for village,
desert, building and build, need, rich or liberal, arm (of body),
rod or goad, face, opposite, wicked, unfriendly, discontented,
difficult, daughter, eulogy, a youth, wary, enjoy, unhappy,
volition, voluntary, unwilling, blind, cautious, blood-kin, coquet
with, slumber, humble, mad, grace or favour, memory or attention,
grandfather, old woman, prepared, duty, necessary, end,
endless, superior, confident, mistake, warmth, heat, glory. The
language of their old religion was mainly Persian, but in the
4th century they derived numerous ecclesiological words from the
Syrians, from whom by way of Edessa and Nisibis Christianity
penetrated eastern Armenia. The language of the garden and
the names of plants were also Persian. They had their own
numerals, but the words for one thousand and for ten thousand
are Persian.</p>

<p>Yet more indicative of the extent of the Persian influence is the
adoption of the adjectival ending -<i>akan</i> and -<i>zan</i>, added to purely
Armenian words; also of the preposition <i>ham</i>, answering to <i>con</i>
in &ldquo;conjoin,&rdquo; &ldquo;conspire,&rdquo; added to purely Armenian words, as
in <i>hambarnam</i>, I take away, and <i>hamboir</i>, a kiss, a word which,
strange to say, the Iberians in turn borrowed from the Armenians.
From Persia also the Armenians took their names for surrounding
races, <i>e.g.</i> <i>Tatshik</i> or <i>Tajik</i>, first for Arab and then for Turk,
<i>Ariq</i> for Persians, <i>Kapkoh</i> for Caucasus, <i>Hrazdan</i>, <i>Vaspuragan</i>,
&amp;c. The Armenians call themselves <i>Hay</i>, plural <i>Hayq</i>; their
country <i>Hayasdan</i>. The Iberians they called <i>Virq</i> or <i>Wirq</i>
(where <i>q</i> marks the plural), the Medes <i>Marq</i>, the Cappadocians
<i>Gamirq</i> (Cimmerians), the Greeks Yûnes or Ionians; Ararat they
call <i>Masis</i>, the Euphrates the <i>Aradsan</i>, the Tigris <i>Teglath</i>,
Erzerum is <i>Karin</i>, Edessa <i>Urhha</i>, Nisibis <i>Mdsbin</i>, Ctesiphon
<i>Tizbon</i>, &amp;c.</p>

<p>When the Persian and other loan-words are removed, a stock
remains of native words and forms governed by other phonetic
laws than those which govern the Aryan, <i>i.e.</i> Indian and Iranic,
branch of the Indo-European tongues. Armenian appears to be
a half-way dialect between the Aryan branch and Slavo-lettic.
Much, however, in Armenian philology remains unexplained.
For example the plural of nouns, pronouns and the first and
second persons plural of verbs are all formed by adding a <i>q</i> or <i>k</i>,
which has no parallel in any Indo-Germanic tongue. The
genitive plural again is formed by adding a <i>tz</i> or <i>c</i>, and the same
consonant characterizes the composite aorist and the conjunctive.
In all three cases it is unexplained. In the verbs the termination
<i>m</i> for the first singular at once explains itself, and the <i>n</i> of the
third plural is the Indo-Germanic <i>nti</i>. But not so the second
person singular ending in <i>s</i>, <i>e.g.</i> <i>berem</i>, I bear, <i>beres</i>, thou bearest.
This has a superficial likeness to the I.-G. <i>esi</i> in <i>bheresi</i>, &ldquo;thou
bearest.&rdquo; Yet we should expect the <i>s</i> between vowels to vanish,
and give us in Armenian <i>berê</i>. Perhaps, therefore, an old variant
of <i>esi</i>, similar to the <span class="grk" title="essi">&#7952;&#963;&#963;&#943;</span>, lies behind the Armenian <i>es</i>,
thou art, and the <i>es</i> in <i>beres</i>, thou bearest. In any case it is clear
that many of the oldest forms which Armenian shared with other
Indo-Germanic dialects were lost and replaced by forms of which
the origin is obscure. Perhaps a closer study of Mingrelian and
Georgian will explain some of these peculiarities, for these and
their cognate tongues must have had a wider range in the 7th and
8th centuries <span class="scs">B.C.</span> than they had later when clear history begins.
The attempts made by S. Bugge to assimilate Old Armenian to
Etruscan, and by P. Jensen to explain from it the Hittite inscriptions,
appear to be fanciful. There is a large Semitic influence
traceable in Armenian due to their early contact with the Syriac-speaking peoples to the south and east of them, and later to the
Arab conquest. Much remains to be done in the way of collecting
Armenian dialects, for which task there are written materials
as far back as the 12th century over and above the work to be
done by an intelligent traveller armed with a phonograph. Two
main dialects of Armenian are distinguishable to-day, that of
Ararat and Tiflis, and that of Stambul and the coast cities of
Asia Minor. The latter is much overlaid with Tatar or Turkish
words, and the Tatar order of words distinguishes the modern
Armenian sentence from the ancient.</p>

<p>It remains to say that classical Armenian resembles rather the
modern idiom of Van than of western Armenia. It was a plastic
and noble language, capable of rendering faithfully, yet not
servilely, the Greek Bible and Greek fathers. Often the Armenian
translators, and especially after the 5th century, rendered word
for word, preserving the order of the Greek. This literalness,
though unpleasing from a literary standpoint, gives to many of
their ancient versions the value almost of a Greek codex of the
age in which the version was made. The same literalness also
characterizes their translations from Syriac.</p>

<p>The Armenians had a temple literature of their own, which
was destroyed in the 4th and 5th centuries by the Christian
clergy, so thoroughly that barely twenty lines of it
survive in the history of Moses of Khoren (Chorene).
<span class="sidenote">Literature.</span>
Their Christian literature begins about 400 with the invention of
the Armenian alphabet by Mesrop. This was probably an older
alphabet to which Mesrop merely added vowels; but, in order
to pacify the Greek ecclesiastics and the emperor Theodosius the
Less, the Armenians concocted a story that it had been divinely
revealed. Once their alphabet perfected, the catholicus Sahak
formed a school of translators who were sent to Edessa, Athens,
Constantinople, Alexandria, Antioch, Caesarea in Cappadocia,
and elsewhere, to procure codices both in Syriac and Greek and
translate them. From Syriac were made the first version of the
New Testament, the version of Eusebius&rsquo; History and his Life of
Constantine (unless this be from the original Greek), the homilies
of Aphraates, the Acts of Gurias and Samuna, the works of
Ephrem Syrus (partly published in four volumes by the Mechitharists
of Venice). They include the commentaries on the <i>Diatessaron</i>
and the Paulines, Laboubna and History of Addai, the
Syriac canons of the Apostles.</p>

<p>From the original Greek were rendered in the 5th century the
following authors and works. An asterisk is prefixed to those
which have been printed:&mdash;*Eusebius&rsquo; <i>Chronicon</i>; *Philo&rsquo;s lost
commentaries on Genesis and Exodus, and his lost treatises on
Providence and Animals, as well as a great number of his works
still preserved in Greek; *the entire Bible (the New Testament
is a recension after Antiochene Greek texts of an older version
made from the oldest Syriac text); *the Alexander romance
of the pseudo-Callisthenes; *<i>Epistles</i> and <i>Acts</i> of Ignatius of
Antioch; *many homilies of Gregory Thaumaturgus; *Athanasius
(a large number of works, many of them wrongly
attributed); Irenaeus, <i>Adversus Haereses</i> and <i>Ad Marcianum</i>
(recently found); *Hippolytus&rsquo; commentaries on the Song of
Songs and Daniel, and many fragments; *Timotheus&rsquo; life of
Athanasius; Theophilus of Alexandria, various homilies;
*Eusebius of Gabala or Severianus, fifteen Homilies; *Cyril of
Jerusalem, <i>Catecheses</i> and Letter to Constantine; *<i>Wisdom of
Ahikar</i>; *the <i>Apology</i> of Aristides; Gregory of Nazianzus,
thirty-four Homilies; *Nonnus&rsquo; work on Gregory (perhaps a
version of 6th century); Basil of Caesarea, *<i>Hexaëmeron</i>,
fifteen Homilies on faith, epistle to Terentius, ascetic writings
and canons, on the Holy Spirit, to Cledonius, &amp;c. Helladius of
Caesarea&rsquo;s life of Basil; Gregory of Nyssa&rsquo;s treatise on the
Beatitudes, and many other homilies, Commentaries on Song of
Songs, *On Human Nature (Nemesius), panegyrics on sundry
Martyrs, and other works (but some of these versions belong to
the beginning of the 8th century); Epiphanius of Salamis, Commentary
on the Gospels, *<i>On weights and measures</i>, *<i>Physiologus</i>,
canons and many homilies; Evagrius of Pontus, Homilies and
Ascetic works, Letters to Melania, &amp;c.; John Chrysostom,
*Homilies and Prayers, in very beautiful language; *Proclus,
patriarch of Constantinople, many homilies; *Nilus the Ascete, <i>On
the Eight Spirits of Evil</i>; *Josephus, <i>On the Jewish War</i>; Dionysius
of Alexandria, *<i>Against Paul of Samosata</i> and other fragments; Acacius,
bishop of Melitene, *<i>Letters</i> to Sahak; Julius of Rome
(fragments); Zenobius, Homilies (? from Syriac); the <i>History</i>
of Julius Africanus was perhaps also translated in this century,
but it is lost. To the 5th century belong the versions of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page573" id="page573"></a>573</span>
Nicene canons, of which the Armenian text as preserved is barely
intelligible, of the eucharistic rites called of *Basil, *Chrysostom,
*Ignatius and others; also the *Hours or Breviary, the *Rites
of Ordination, Baptism, of the making and release of Penitents,
of Epiphany, and perhaps the many rites of animal sacrifice, for
these are partly originals, partly versions of lost Greek texts.
A mass of martyrs&rsquo; acts were also rendered in this century,
including parts of the lost collection made by Eusebius. Among
these the *<i>Acts and Apology</i> of Apollonius restore a lost 2nd-century
text. The *<i>Canons</i> of Sahak also purport to be translated
from a Greek original about the year 330.</p>

<p>The Armenians were so busy in this century translating Greek
and Syriac fathers that they have left little that is original. Still
a number of historical works survive: *Faustus of Byzantium
relates the events of the period <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 344-392 in a work instinct
with life and racy of the soil. It was perhaps first composed in
Greek, but it gives a faithful picture of the court of the petty
sovereigns of Armenia, of the political organization, of the blood
feuds of the clans, of the planting of Christianity. Procopius
preserves some fragments of the Greek.</p>

<p>The *<i>History of Taron</i>, by Zenobius of Glak, is a somewhat
legendary account of Gregory the Illuminator, and may have been
written in Syriac in the 5th, though it was only Armenized in a
later century.</p>

<p>*Elisaeus Wardapet wrote a history of Wardan (Vardan), and
of the war waged for their faith by the Armenians against the
Sassanids. He was an eye-witness of this struggle, and gives a
good account of the contemporary Mazdaism which the Persians
tried to force on the Armenians. *Lazar of Pharp wrote a history
embracing the events of the 5th century up to the year 485, as a
continuation of the work of Faustus.</p>

<p>*A history of St Gregory and of the conversion of Armenia
by Agathangelus is preserved in Greek, Armenian and Arabic.
The Arabic edited by Professor Marr of St Petersburg seems to
be the oldest form of text. The Greek is a rendering of the
Armenian. It is a compilation, and the second part which
contains the <i>Acts</i> of Gregory and of St Rhipsima seems wholly
legendary. The Greek and Armenian texts were edited together
by Lagarde.</p>

<p>*The <i>History of Armenia</i> by Moses of Khoren (Chorene)
relates events up to about the year 450. It is a compilation,
devoid of historical method, value or veracity, from all sorts of
previous authors, mostly from those which already existed in an
Armenian dress. Some critics put down the date of composition
as low as about 700, and it was certainly retouched in the late
6th century.</p>

<p>*A long volume of rhetorical exercises, based on Aphthonius,
is also ascribed to Moses of Khoren, and appears to be of the 5th
century. The *geography which passes under his name may
belong to the 7th century. Various homilies of Moses survive,
as also of Elisaeus.</p>

<p>Gorium wrote in this century a *<i>Life of Mesrop</i>, and Eznik a
*<i>Refutation of the Sects</i>, based largely on antecedent Greek works.
The sects in question are Paganism, Mazdaism, Greek Philosophy
and Manicheism. A volume of *homilies under the name of
Gregory the Illuminator, but not his, also belongs to this century,
and a series of ascetic discourses attributed to John Mandakuni,
who was patriarch 478-500.</p>

<p>Of the 6th and 7th centuries few works survive except anonymous
versions of the *<i>Acts of Thomas</i> (perhaps from the Syriac),
of the *<i>Acts of Peter and Paul</i>, *of John (pseudo-Prochorus),
*of Bartholomew, and of other apostles; also of *the Acts of
Paul and Thekla, *of Titus, *of the Protevangel, *of the Testaments
of the patriarchs, of the *<i>Gospel of Nicodemus</i>, or <i>Acts of
Pilate</i>, of the *<i>Book of Adam</i>, of the *<i>Deaths of the Prophets</i>, of
the *<i>History of Baruch</i>, of the *Apocalypses of Paul and of the
Virgin Mary, of the *Acts of Sylvester, and of an enormous
number of other similar apocryphs. Some of these may be of the
5th century. Two volumes of these apocryphs of the Old and
New Testaments have recently been published at Venice. To
these centuries belong also the versions of the Acts of the council
of Ephesus, of Gangra, Laodicea and of other councils. To the
late 7th century belong the *calendarial works of Ananiah of
Shirak, who also has left a *<i>chronicon</i> compiled from Eusebius,
Andreas of Crete, Hippolytus and other sources. In the *<i>Letter-book
of the Patriarchs</i>, lately printed at Tiflis, are to be found
a number of controversial monophysite tracts of these and the
succeeding three centuries, important for church history. It
includes a mass of documents relative to the churches of Iberia
and Albania. The chief literary monument of the 7th century is
the history of the wars of Heraclius and of the early Mahommedan
conquests in Asia Minor, by the bishop Sebeos, who was an eye-witness.
The *history of the Albanians of the Caucasus, by
Moses Kalankatuatzi, also belongs to the end of this century.
To the middle of the 7th century also belong the translations of
Aristotle&rsquo;s treatises *<i>On the Categories</i>, and *<i>On Interpretation</i>,
and of *Porphyry&rsquo;s <i>Isagog&#275;</i>, as well as of voluminous Greek
commentaries on these books; the version of the *Grammar of
Dionysius Thrax and an incomplete Euclid. The translator
was one David called the Invincible, who also wrote monophysite
tracts. At the end of this 7th century one Philo of
Tirak is supposed to have made the version of the *History
of Socrates, unless indeed it was made earlier. To this century
also seems to belong the Armenian version of a *history of the
Iberians, by Djuansher, a work full of valuable information.</p>

<p>The early 8th century was a time of great literary activity.
Gregory Asheruni wrote an important *commentary on the
Jerusalem Lectionary, and his friend *John the catholicus (717-728)
commentaries on the other liturgical works of his church;
he also collected all existing canon law, Greek or Armenian,
respected in his church, wrote *against the Paulicians and
Docetae, and composed many beautiful hymns. *Leoncius the
priest has left a history of the first caliphs, and Stephanus, bishop
of Siunik, translated the *controversial works of Cyril of
Alexandria (whose <i>Glaphyra</i> and commentaries, however, seem
to have been translated at an earlier period). He also translated
the works of Dionysius the Areopagite, commented on the
Armenian breviary and wrote hymns.</p>

<p>In the 9th century Zachariah, catholicus, the correspondent of
Photius, wrote many eloquent homilies for the various church
feasts. Shapuh Bagratuni wrote a history of his age, now lost.
Mashtotz, catholicus, collected in one volume the Armenian
rituals.</p>

<p>In the 10th century (<i>c.</i> 925) the catholicus John VI. issued his
*history of Armenia, and Thomas Artsruni a *history of his clan
carried up to the year 936. Ananias of Mok (943-965) wrote a
great work against the Paulicians, unfortunately lost. Chosroes
wrote a *commentary on the eucharistic rites and breviary,
*Mesrop a history of Nerses the Great; *Stephen of Asolik wrote
a history of the world, and a commentary on Jeremiah; *Gregory
of Narek his famous meditations and hymns; Samuel Kamrdjtsoretzi
a commentary on the Lectionary based on Gregory
Asheruni.</p>

<p>In the 11th century the catholicus Gregory translated many
Acts of Martyrs, and John Kozerhn wrote a history, now lost, as
well as a work on the Armenian calendar; Stephen Asolik a
*history of Armenia up to the year 1004; *Aristaces of Lastiverd
a valuable history of the conquest of Armenia by the Seljuk
caliphs. We may also mention a *monophysite work against
the Greek doctor Theopistus by Paul of Taron; *letters and
poems of Gregory Magistros, who also was the translator of the
*<i>Laws, Timaeus</i> and other dialogues of Plato.</p>

<p>The 12th century saw many remarkable writers, mostly in
Cilician Armenia, viz. Nerses the Graceful (d. 1165), author of an
*<i>Elegy</i> on the taking of Edessa, of *voluminous hymns, of long
*Pastoral Letters and Synodal orations of value for the historian
of eastern churches. *Samuel of Ani composed a chronicle up to
1179. Nerses of Lambron, archbishop of Tarsus, left a *Synodal
oration, a *Commentary on the liturgy, &amp;c., and his contemporary
Gregory of Tlay an *<i>Elegy</i> on the capture of Jerusalem,
and various *dogmatic works. In this century the *history of
Michael the Syrian was translated; Ignatius and Sargis composed
*commentaries on Luke and *the catholic epistles, and
*Matthew of Edessa a valuable history of the years 952-1136,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page574" id="page574"></a>574</span>
continued up to 1176 by Gregory the priest. Mechithar
(Mekhitar) Kosh (d. 1207) wrote an elegant *<i>Book of Fables</i>,
and compiled a *corpus of civil and canon law (partly from
Byzantine codes).</p>

<p>In the 13th century the following works or authors are to be
noticed:&mdash;*history of Kiriakos of Ganzak, which contains much
about the Mongols, Georgians and Albanians; *Malakia the
monk&rsquo;s history of the Tatars up to 1272; *Chronicle of Mechithar
of Ani (fragmentary); *Vahram&rsquo;s rhymed chronicle of the
kings of Lesser Armenia; *history of the world, by Vartan, up to
1269. In this century mostly falls the redaction of a large fable
literature, recently edited in three volumes by Professor Marr of
St Petersburg.</p>

<p>14th century: *history of Siunik, by Stephen Orbelian,
archbishop of that province 1287-1304; *Sempat&rsquo;s chronicle
of Lesser Armenia (952-1274), carried on by a continuator to
1331; *Mechithar of Airivanq, a chronography; *Hethoum&rsquo;s
account of the Tatars, and chronography of the years 1076-1307.
John of Orotn (d. 1388) compiled commentaries on John&rsquo;s
gospel and the Paulines, and wrote homilies and monophysite
works; his disciple Gregory of Dathev (b. 1340) compiled a
*<i>Summa theologiae</i> called the <i>Book of Questions</i>, in the style of the
<i>Summa</i> of Aquinas, which had been translated into Armenian
c. 1330, as were a little later the *<i>Summa</i> of Albertus and works
of other schoolmen.</p>

<p>15th century: *<i>History of Tamerlane</i>, by Thomas of Medsoph,
carried up to 1447.</p>

<p>17th century, Araqel of Tabriz wrote a *history of the Persian
invasions of Armenia in the years 1602-1661.</p>

<p>In the above list are not included a number of medical,
astrological, calendarial and philological or lexicographic works,
mostly written during or since the Cilician or crusading epoch.
The hymns used in Armenian worship rarely go back to the 5th
century; and they were still few in number and brief in length
when Nerses the Graceful and his contemporaries more than
doubled their number and bulk in the 12th century. Most
Armenian poems embody acrostics, and their poets began to
rhyme in the 8th century or thereabouts. Since the 15th century
a certain number of profane poets have arisen, whose work is
less jejune on the whole than that of the hymn and canticle
writers of an earlier age. Gregory Magistros (d. 1058) abridged
the whole of the Old and New Testaments in a *rhyming poem,
and set a fashion to later writers. Such works as *<i>Barlaam and
Josaphat</i>. the *<i>History of the Seven Sages</i>, the *<i>Wisdom of Ahikar</i>,
the *<i>Tale of the City of Bronze</i>, were freely turned into verse in the
13th and following centuries.</p>

<p>It will be realized from the above enumeration of works
written in each century that Armenian literature was purely
monkish. There was no epic or romance literature; although
this was not lacking in the contiguous country of Georgia,
where there seem to have always been knights and ladies willing
to read and keep alive a literature of poetry and narrative, not
altogether suitable for monks, and more akin to Persian literature.</p>

<p>Other forms of faith than the orthodox had a hold in Armenia,
particularly the Nestorian and the Manichean. Sundry works of
Mani were translated in the year 588, but are lost. Perhaps
certain works of Diodore of Tarsus survive, but the orthodox
monks were so vigilant that there is little chance of finding any
other monuments than those of the stereotyped orthodoxy.</p>

<p>The 16th century saw the first books printed in Armenian.
A press was set up at Venice in 1565, and the psalms and breviary
were printed. In 1584 the Roman propaganda began its issue of
Armenian books with a Gregorian calendar. In the 17th century
presses were working at Lembourg, Milan, Paris, Isfahan (where
in 1640 a large folio of the <i>Lives of the Fathers of the Desert</i>
appeared), in Leghorn, Amsterdam (where in 1664 the first
edition of the Hymn-book, in 1666 the first Bible, and in 1667 the
first Ritual were printed), Marseilles, Constantinople, Leipzig
and Padua.</p>

<p>The press which has done most in printing Armenian authors
is that of the Mechitharists of Venice. Here in 1836 was issued a
magnificent thesaurus of the Armenian language, with the Latin
and Greek equivalents of each word. At that time there was no
dictionary of any language and literature to be compared with
this for exhaustiveness and accuracy. There are now Armenian
presses all over the world, reprinting old books or issuing new
works, often translations of modern writers, English, French,
Russian and German.</p>

<p>The chief collections of old Armenian MSS. are: at the
convent of *Echmiadzin at Valarshapat; at Stambul in the
library of the fathers of St Anthony; at Venice in the Mechitharist
convent of San Lazaro; at the *Mechitharist convent in Vienna;
in the *Royal library at Vienna; in the *Paris Bibliothèque
Nationale; in the Vatican library; in the British Museum; in
the *Bodleian; in the Rylands library; in the *Berlin and
*Munich libraries; *in Tübingen; in St Petersburg, and in the
*Lazarev institute at Moscow; at New Joulfa, the Armenian
suburb of Isfahan. Private collections have been made by Mr
Rendel Harris in Birmingham (presented to the university of
Leiden); at Parham and elsewhere. A printed catalogue exists
of those marked with an asterisk.</p>

<p><span class="bold">ARMENTIÈRES,<a name="ar136" id="ar136"></a></span> a town of northern France, in the department
of Nord, on the Lys, 13 m. W.N.W. of Lille on the Northern
railway from that city to Dunkirk. Pop. (1906) 25,408. The
chief building is the hôtel de ville with a 17th-century belfry.
There are communal colleges for girls and boys, a board of
trade-arbitrators, a chamber of commerce and a national technical
school. The town is an important centre for the spinning and
weaving of flax and cotton; bleaching, dyeing and the
manufacture of machinery are among the other industries. Its
industrial prosperity dates from the middle ages, when, however,
woollen, not cotton, goods were the staple product.</p>

and complete chin, neck and cheek protection, closely connected
with the gorget. It is distinguished from the basinet by its
roundness, and by the fact that it protects the neck and chin by
strong plates, instead of a &ldquo;camail&rdquo; or loose collar of mail;
from the salade and heaume by its close fit and skull-cap shape;

<p><span class="bold">ARMFELT, GUSTAF MAURITZ,<a name="ar138" id="ar138"></a></span> <span class="sc">Count</span> (1757-1814), son of
Charles II.&rsquo;s general, Carl Gustaf Armfelt, was born in Finland
on the 31st of March 1757. In 1774 he became an ensign in the
guards, but his frivolity provoked the displeasure of Gustavus III.
and he thought it prudent to go abroad. Subsequently, however,
(1780) he met the king again at Spa and completely won the
monarch&rsquo;s favour by his natural amiability, intelligence and
brilliant social gifts. Henceforth his fortune was made. At first
he was the <i>maître des plaisirs</i> of the Swedish court, but it was not
long before more serious affairs were entrusted to him. He took
part in the negotiations with Catherine II. (1783) and with the
Danish government (1787), and during the Russian war of 1788-90
he was one of the king&rsquo;s most trusted and active counsellors.
He also displayed great valour in the field. In 1788 when the
Danes unexpectedly invaded Sweden and threatened Gothenburg,
it was Armfelt who under the king&rsquo;s directions organized the
Dalecarlian levies and led them to victory. He remained
absolutely faithful to Gustavus when nearly the whole of the
nobility fell away from him; brilliantly distinguished himself in
the later phases of the Russian war; and was the Swedish
plenipotentiary at the conclusion of the peace of Verelä. During the
last years of Gustavus III. his influence was paramount, though
he protested against his master&rsquo;s headstrong championship of the
Bourbons. On his deathbed Gustavus III. (1792) committed
the care of his infant son to Armfelt and appointed him a member
of the council of regency; but the anti-Gustavian duke-regent
Charles sent Armfelt as Swedish ambassador to Naples to get rid
of him. From Naples Armfelt communicated with Catherine II.,
urging her to bring about by means of a military demonstration
a change in the Swedish government in favour of the Gustavians.
The plot was discovered by the regent&rsquo;s spies, and Armfelt only
escaped from the man-of-war sent to Naples to seize him, with the
assistance of Queen Caroline. He now fled to Russia, where he
was interned at Kaluga, while at home he was condemned to
confiscation and death as a traitor, and his unjustly accused
mistress Magdalena Rudenschöld was publicly whipped to gratify
an old grudge of the regent&rsquo;s. When Gustavus IV. attained his
majority, Armfelt was completely rehabilitated and sent as
Swedish ambassador to Vienna (1802), but was obliged to quit
that post two years later for sharply attacking the Austrian
government&rsquo;s attitude towards Bonaparte. From 1805 to 1807
he was commander-in-chief of the Swedish forces in Pomerania,
where he displayed great ability and retarded the conquest of the
duchy as long as it was humanly possible. On his return home,
he was appointed commander-in-chief on the Norwegian frontier,
but could do nothing owing to the <i>ordres, contre-ordres et désordres</i>
of his lunatic master. He would have nothing to say to the
revolutionaries who in 1809 deposed Gustavus IV. and his whole
family. Armfelt was the most courageous of the supporters of
the crown prince Gustavus, and when Bernadotte was elected
resolved to retire to Finland. His departure was accelerated
by a decree of expulsion as a conspirator (1811). Over the
impressionable Alexander I. of Russia, Armfelt exercised almost as
great an influence as Czartoryski, especially as regards Finnish
affairs. He contributed more than any one else to the erection
of the grand-duchy into an autonomous state, and was its first
and best governor-general. The plan of the Russian defensive
campaigns is, with great probability, also attributed to him, and
he gained Alexander over to the plan of uniting Norway with
Sweden. He died at Tsarskoe Selo on the 19th of August 1814.</p>

<p><span class="bold">ARMIDALE,<a name="ar139" id="ar139"></a></span> a town in Sandon county, New South Wales,
Australia, 313 m. by rail N. of Sydney. Pop. (1901) 4249. It
lies at an elevation of 3313 ft., in a picturesque mountainous
district, for the most part pastoral and agricultural, though it
contains some alluvial gold diggings. Antimony is found in large
quantities near the town. Armidale is a cathedral town, being

<p><span class="bold">ARMILLA,<a name="ar140" id="ar140"></a></span> <span class="sc">Armil</span> or <span class="sc">Armillary Sphere</span> (from the Lat.
<i>armilla</i>, a bracelet), an instrument used in astronomy. In its
simplest form, consisting of a ring fixed in the plane of the
equator, the <i>armilla</i> is one of the most ancient of astronomical
instruments. Slightly developed, it was crossed by another ring
fixed in the plane of the meridian. The first was an equinoctial,
the second a solstitial armilla. Shadows were used as indices of
the sun&rsquo;s position, in combination with angular divisions. When
several rings or circles were combined representing the great
circles of the heavens, the instrument became an armillary
sphere. Armillae are said to have been in early use in China.
Eratosthenes (276-196 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>) used most probably a solstitial
armilla for measuring the obliquity of the ecliptic. Hipparchus
(160-125 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>) probably used an armillary sphere of four rings.
Ptolemy (<i>c.</i> <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 107-161) describes his instrument in the
<i>Syntaxis</i> (book v. chap, i.), and it is of great interest as an
example of the armillary sphere passing into the spherical
astrolabe. It consisted of a graduated circle inside which
another could slide, carrying two small tubes diametrically
opposite, the instrument being kept vertical by a plumb-line.</p>

<p>No material advance was made on Ptolemy&rsquo;s instrument until
Tycho Brahe, whose elaborate armillary spheres passing into
astrolabes are figured in his <i>Astronomiae Instauratae Mechanica</i>.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page576" id="page576"></a>576</span>
The armillary sphere survives as useful for teaching, and may
be described as a skeleton celestial globe, the series of rings
representing the great circles of the heavens, and revolving on an
axis within a horizon. With the earth as centre such a sphere
is known as Ptolemaic; with the sun as centre, as Copernican.</p>

<p>The designer of the instrument shown no doubt thought that
the north pole might suitably have the same ornament as was
used to mark N. on the compass card, and so surmounted it
with the <i>fleur-de-lys</i>, traditionally chosen for that purpose on
the compass by Flavio Gioja in honour of Charles of Anjou, king
of Sicily and Naples.</p>

<p>Armillary spheres occur in many old sculptures, paintings
and engravings; and from these sources we know that they were
made for suspension, for resting on the ground or on a table, for
holding by a short handle, or either for holding or for resting on a
stand.</p>

<p><span class="bold">ARMINIUS,<a name="ar141" id="ar141"></a></span> the Latinized form of the name of <span class="sc">Hermann</span>, or
more probably <span class="sc">Armin</span> (17 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>-<span class="scs">A.D.</span> 21), the German national
hero. He was a son of a certain Segimer, a prince of the tribe of
the Cherusci, and in early life served with distinction as an officer
in the Roman armies. Returning to his own people he found
them chafing under the yoke of the Roman governor, Quintilius
Varus; he entertained for them hopes of freedom, and cautiously
inducing neighbouring tribes to join his standard he led the
rebellion which broke out in the autumn of <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 9. Heavily
laden with baggage the troops of Varus were decoyed into the
fastnesses of the Teutoburger Wald, and there attacked, the
completeness of the barbarian victory being attested by the
virtual annihilation of three legions, by the voluntary death of
Varus, and by the terror which reigned in Rome when the news
of the defeat became known, a terror which found utterance
in the emperor&rsquo;s despairing cry: &ldquo;Varus, give me back my
legions!&rdquo; Then in <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 15 Germanicus Caesar led the Romans
against Arminius, and captured his wife, Thusnelda. An
indecisive battle was fought in the Teutoburger Wald, where
Germanicus narrowly escaped the fate of Varus, and in the
following year Arminius was defeated. The hero&rsquo;s later years
were spent in fighting against Marbod, prince of the Marcomanni,
and in disputes with his own people occasioned probably by his
desire to found a powerful kingdom. He was murdered in <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 21.</p>

<p>In 1875 a great monument to Arminius was completed. This
stands on the Grotenburg mountain near Detmold. Klopstock
and other poets have used his exploits as material for dramas.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>Much discussion has taken place with regard to the exact spot in
the Teutoburger Wald where the great battle between Arminius and
Varus was fought. There is an immense literature on this subject,
and the following may be consulted:&mdash;T. Mommsen, <i>Die Ortlichkeit
der Varusschlacht</i> (1885); E. Meyer, <i>Untersuchungen über die

<p><span class="bold">ARMINIUS, JACOBUS<a name="ar142" id="ar142"></a></span> (1560-1609), Dutch theologian, author
of the modified reformed theology that receives its name of
Arminian from him, was born at Oudewater, South Holland, on
the 10th of October 1560. Arminius is a Latinized form of his
patronymic Hermanns or Hermansen. His father, Hermann
Jakobs, a cutler, died while he was an infant, leaving a widow and
three children. Theodorus Aemilius, a priest, who had turned
Protestant, adopting Jakob, sent him to school at Utrecht, but
died when his charge was in his fifteenth year. Rudolf Snellius
(Snel van Roijen, 1546-1613), the mathematician, a native of
Oudewater, then a professor at Marburg, happening at the time
to visit his early home, met the boy, saw promise in him and
undertook his maintenance and education. But hardly was he
settled at Marburg when the news came that the Spaniards had
besieged and taken Oudewater, and murdered its inhabitants
almost without exception. Arminius hurried home, but only to
find all his relatives slain. In February the same year (1575),
the university of Leiden had been founded, and thither, by the
kindness of friends, Arminius was sent to study theology. The
six years he remained at Leiden (1576-1582) were years of active
and innovating thought in Holland. The War of Independence
had started conflicting tendencies in men&rsquo;s minds. To some it
seemed to illustrate the necessity of the state tolerating only one
religion, but to others the necessity of the state tolerating all.
Dirck Coornhert argued, in private conferences and public
disputations, that it was wrong to punish heretics, and his great
opponents were, as a rule, the ministers, who maintained that
there was no room for more than one religion in a state. Caspar
Koolhaes, the heroic minister of Leiden&mdash;its first lecturer, too,
in divinity&mdash;pleaded against a too rigid uniformity, for such
an agreement on &ldquo;fundamentals&rdquo; as had allowed Reformed,
Lutherans and Anabaptists to unite. Leiden had been happy,
too, in its first professors. There taught in theology Guillaume
Feuguières or Feuguereius (d. 1613), a mild divine, who had
written a treatise on persuasion in religion, urging that as to
it &ldquo;men could be led, not driven&rdquo;; Lambert Danaeus, who
deserves remembrance as the first to discuss Christian ethics
scientifically, apart from dogmatics; Johannes Drusius, the
Orientalist, one of the most enlightened and advanced scholars of
his day, settled later at Franeker; Johann Kolmann the younger,
best known by his saying that high Calvinism made God &ldquo;both
a tyrant and an executioner.&rdquo; Snellius, Arminius&rsquo;s old patron,
now removed to Leiden, expounded the Ramist philosophy, and
did his best to start his students on the search after truth,
unimpeded by the authority of Aristotle. Under these men
and influences, Arminius studied with signal success; and the
promise he gave induced the merchants&rsquo; gild of Amsterdam to
bear the further expenses of his education. In 1582 he went to
Geneva, studied there awhile under Theodore Beza, but had
soon, owing to his active advocacy of the Ramist philosophy, to
remove to Basel. After a short but brilliant career there he
turned to Geneva, studied for three years, travelled, in 1586, in
Italy, heard Giacomo Zarabella (1533-1589) lecture on philosophy
in Padua, visited Rome, and, open-minded enough to see its good
as well as its evil, was suspected by the stern Dutch Calvinists of
&ldquo;popish&rdquo; leanings. Next year he was called to Amsterdam,
and there, in 1588, was ordained. He soon acquired the reputation
of being a good preacher and faithful pastor. He was commissioned
to organize the educational system of the city, and is
said to have done it well. He greatly distinguished himself by
fidelity to duty during a plague that devastated Amsterdam in
1602. In 1603 he was called, in succession to Franz Junius, to a
theological professorship at Leiden, which he held till his death
on the 19th of October 1609.</p>

<p>Arminius is best known as the founder of the anti-Calvinistic
school in Reformed theology, which created the Remonstrant
Church in Holland (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Remonstrants</a></span>), and contributed to form
the Arminian tendency or party in England. He was a man of
mild and liberal spirit, broadened by varied culture,
constitutionally averse from narrow views and enforced uniformity.
He lived in a period of severe systematizing. The Reformed
strengthened itself against the Roman Catholic theology by
working itself, on the one hand, into vigorous logical consistency,
and supporting itself, on the other, on the supreme authority of
the Scriptures. Calvin&rsquo;s first principle, the absolute sovereignty of
God, had been so applied as to make the divine decree determine
alike the acts and the destinies of men; and his formal principle
had been so construed as to invest his system with the authority
of the source whence it professed to have been drawn. Calvinism
had become, towards the close of the 16th century, supreme in
Holland, but the very rigour of the uniformity it exacted provoked
a reaction. Coornhert could not plead for the toleration of
heretics without assailing the dominant Calvinism, and so he
opposed a conditional to its unconditional predestination. The
two ministers of Delft, who had debated the point with him,
had, the better to turn his arguments, descended from the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page577" id="page577"></a>577</span>
supralapsarian to the infralapsarian position, <i>i.e.</i> made the divine
decree, instead of precede and determine, succeed the Fall.
This seemed to the high Calvinists of Holland a grave heresy.
Arminius, fresh from Geneva, familiar with the dialectics of Beza,
appeared to many the man able to speak the needed word, and so,
in 1589, he was simultaneously invited by the ecclesiastical court
of Amsterdam to refute Coornhert, and by Martin Lydius, professor
at Franeker, to combat the two infralapsarian ministers
of Delft. Thus led to confront the questions of necessity and
free will, his own views became unsettled, and the further he
pursued his inquiries the more he was inclined to assert the
freedom of man and limit the range of the unconditional decrees
of God. This change became gradually more apparent in his
preaching and in his conferences with his clerical associates, and
occasioned much controversy in the ecclesiastical courts where,
however, he successfully defended his position. The controversy
was embittered and the differences sharpened by his appointment
to the professorship at Leiden. He had as colleague Franz
Gomarus, a strong supralapsarian, perfervid, irrepressible; and
their collisions, personal, official, political, tended to develop and
define their respective positions.</p>

<p>Arminius died, worn out by uncongenial controversy and
ecclesiastical persecution, before his system had been elaborated
into the logical consistency it attained in the hands of his
celebrated successor, Simon Episcopius; but though inchoate in
detail, it was in its principles clear and coherent enough. These
may be thus stated:</p>

<p>1. The decree of God is, when it concerns His own actions,
absolute, but when it concerns man&rsquo;s, conditional, <i>i.e.</i> the decree
relative to the Saviour to be appointed and the salvation to be
provided is absolute, but the decree relative to the persons saved
or condemned is made to depend on the acts&mdash;belief and repentance
in the one case, unbelief and impenitence in the other&mdash;of
the persons themselves.</p>

<p>2. The providence or government of God, while sovereign, is
exercised in harmony with the nature of the creatures governed,
<i>i.e.</i> the sovereignty of God is so exercised as to be compatible
with the freedom of man.</p>

<p>3. Man is by original nature, through the assistance of divine
grace, free, able to will and perform the right; but is in his fallen
state, of and by himself, unable to do so; he needs to be regenerated
in all his powers before he can do what is good and pleasing
to God.</p>

<p>4. Divine grace originates, maintains and perfects all the good
in man, so much so that he cannot, though regenerate, conceive,
will or do any good thing without it.</p>

<p>5. The saints possess, by the grace of the Holy Spirit, sufficient
strength to persevere to the end in spite of sin and the flesh, but
may so decline from sound doctrine as to cause divine grace to be
ineffectual.</p>

<p>6. Every believer may be assured of his own salvation.</p>

<p>7. It is possible for a regenerate man to live without sin.</p>

<p>Arminius&rsquo;s works are mostly occasional treatises drawn from
him by controversial emergencies, but they everywhere exhibit
a calm, well-furnished, undogmatic and progressive mind. He
was essentially an amiable man, who hated the zeal for an
impossible orthodoxy that constrained &ldquo;the church to institute
a search after crimes which have not betrayed an existence, yea,
and to drag into open contentions those who are meditating no
evil.&rdquo; His friend Peter Bertius, who pronounced his funeral
oration, closed it with these words: &ldquo;There lived a man whom
it was not possible for those who knew him sufficiently to esteem;
those who entertained no esteem for him are such as never knew
him well enough to appreciate his merits.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>The works of Arminius (in Latin) were published in a single quarto
volume at Leiden in 1629, at Frankfort in 1631 and 1635. Two
volumes of an English translation, with copious notes, by James
Nichols, were published at London, 1825-1828; three volumes
(complete) at Buffalo, 1853. A life was written by Caspar Brandt,
son of Gerard Brandt, the historian of the Dutch reformation, and
published in 1724; republished and annotated by J.L. Mosheim in
1725; and translated into English by the Rev. John Guthrie, 1854.
James Nichols also wrote a life (London, 1843).</p>

<p><span class="bold">ARMISTICE<a name="ar143" id="ar143"></a></span> (from Lat. <i>arma</i>, arms, and <i>sistere</i>, to stop), a
suspension of hostilities by mutual agreement between two
nations at war, or their respective forces. An armistice may be
either general or particular; in the first case there is a complete
cessation of hostile operations in every part of the dominions of
the belligerent powers; in the second there is merely a temporary
truce between two contending armies, or between a besieged
fortress and the force besieging it. Such a temporary truce, when
for a very limited period and for a special purpose, <i>e.g.</i> the
collection of the wounded and the burial of the dead, is termed
a <i>suspension of arms</i>. A general armistice cannot be concluded
by the commanders-in-chief unless special authority has been
previously delegated to them by their respective governments;
otherwise any arrangement entered into by them requires subsequent
ratification by the supreme powers of the states. A partial
truce may be concluded by the officers of the respective powers,
without any special authority from their governments, wherever,
from the nature and extent of the commands they exercise,
their duties could not be efficiently discharged without their
possession of such a power. The conduct of belligerent parties
during an armistice is usually regulated in modern warfare by
express agreement between the parties, but where this is not the
case the following general conditions may be laid down. (1) Each
party may do, within the limits prescribed by the truce, whatever
he could have done in time of peace. For example, he can raise
troops, collect stores, receive reinforcements and fortify places
that are not actually in a state of siege. (2) Neither party can
take advantage of the armistice to do what he could not have
done had military operations continued. Thus he cannot throw
provisions or reinforcements into a besieged town, and neither
besiegers nor besieged are at liberty to repair their fortifications
or erect new works. (3) All things contained in places the
possession of which was contested, must remain in the state
in which they were before the armistice began. Any infringement
by either party of the conditions of the truce entitles
the other to recommence hostile operations without previous
intimation.</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">ARMOIRE,<a name="ar144" id="ar144"></a></span> the French name (cf. <span class="sc">Almery</span>) given to a tall
movable cupboard, or &ldquo;wardrobe,&rdquo; with one or more doors. It
has varied considerably in shape and size, and the decoration of
its doors and sides has faithfully represented mutations of fashion
and modifications of use. It was originally exceedingly massive
and found its chief decoration in elaborate hinges and locks of
beaten iron. The finer ecclesiastical armoires or aumbries which
have come down to us&mdash;used in churches for the safe custody of
vestments, eucharistic vessels, reliquaries and other precious
objects&mdash;are usually painted, sometimes even upon the interior,
with sacred subjects or with incidents from the lives of the saints.
The cathedrals of Bayeux and Noyon contain famous examples;
the most typical English one is in York minster. By the end of
the 14th century, when the carpenter and the wood-carver had
acquired a better mastery of their material, the taste for painted
surfaces appears to have given place to the vogue of carving, and
the simple rectangular panels gradually became sculptured with
a simple motive, such as the linen-fold or parchment patterns.
In the treasury of St Germain l&rsquo;Auxerrois the ends of the
15th-century armoires are treated in this way. In that and the two
following centuries the keys and the escutcheons of the locks
became highly ornamental; usually in forged iron, they were
occasionally made of more precious metals. By slow degrees the
shape of this receptacle changed&mdash;from breadth was evolved
height, and the tall form of armoire became characteristic. The
Renaissance exercised a notable effect upon this, as upon so
many other varieties of furniture. It became less obviously and
aggressively a thing of utility; its proportions shrank from the
massive to the elegant; its artistic effectiveness was vastly
enhanced by its division into an upper and a lower part. Enriched
with columns and pilasters, its panels carved with
mythology, its canopied niches filled with sculptured statuettes,
and terminating with a rich cornice and perhaps a broken
pediment, it was widely removed in appearance, if not in purpose,
from the uncompromising iron-mounted receptacle of earlier
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page578" id="page578"></a>578</span>
generations. During the 16th century, when the surging impulses
of the Renaissance had died away, the armoire relapsed
into plainness, its proportions increased, and it was again constructed in one piece. Ere long, however, it grew more sumptuous
than ever. Boulle encrusted it with marqueterie from
designs by Bérain; it glowed with <i>amorini</i>, with the torches and
arrows of Cupid, with the garlands which he weaves for his
captives, and when allusiveness left a corner vacant, it was filled
with arabesques in ebony or ivory, in brass or white metal.
While the royal palaces and the hôtels of the great nobility were
filled with those costly splendours, the ordinary cabinetmaker
continued to construct his modest pieces, and by the middle of
the 18th century the armoire was found in every French house,
ample in width and high in proportion to the lofty rooms of the
period. It is not to be supposed that so useful a piece of furniture
was confined to France. It was used, more or less, throughout
a considerable part of Europe, but it was distinctively Gallic
nevertheless, and never became thoroughly acclimatized elsewhere
until about the beginning of the 19th century, when it
developed into the glass-fronted wardrobe which is now an
essential detail in the plenishing of the bed-chamber, not merely
in France and England, but in many other countries. The
<i>armoire à glace</i> was known and occasionally made in France as
far back as the middle of the 18th century, and almost the earliest
mention of it connects it with the scandalous relations of the
Maréchal de Richelieu and the beautiful <i>fermière générale</i>, Mme
de la Popelinière, who had one made to mask a secret door. In
the conventional and not very attractive wardrobe of commerce
it is difficult to descry the gracious characteristics of the armoire
of the Renaissance or the 17th century, and it is not altogether
surprising that Théodore de Banville should have condemned one
of the most solidly useful of household necessaries as a &ldquo;hideous
monster.&rdquo;</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">ARMORICA<a name="ar145" id="ar145"></a></span> (<span class="sc">Aremorica</span>), the Roman name, derived from
two Celtic words meaning the &ldquo;seaside&rdquo; (<i>ar</i>, on, and <i>mor</i>, sea),
for the land of the Armorici, roughly the peninsula of Brittany.
At the time of the Roman advance on Gaul there were five
principal tribes in Armorica, the Namneti, the Veneti, the Osismii,
the Curiosolitae and the Redones. It was subdued by Caesar,
who entirely destroyed the seafaring tribe of its south coast, the
Veneti. Under the Empire it formed part of the province of
Gallia Lugudunensis (Lugdunensis). It contained hardly any
towns, though many large country houses, and was perhaps less
Romanized than the rest of Gaul. In and after the later part of
the 5th century it received many Celtic immigrants from the
British Isles, fleeing (it is said) from the Saxons; and the Celtic
dialect which the Bretons still speak is thought to owe its origin
to these immigrants. (See further <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Brittany</a></span>.)</p>

<p><span class="bold">ARMOUR, PHILIP DANFORTH<a name="ar146" id="ar146"></a></span> (1832-1901), American
merchant and philanthropist, was born in Stockbridge, New
York, on the 16th of May 1832. He was educated at Cazenovia
Academy, Cazenovia, N.Y., worked for several years on his
father&rsquo;s farm, and in 1852 with a small party went overland to
California, a large part of the journey being made on foot. Here
during the next four years he laid the foundations of his fortune.
In 1856 he became associated with his friend, Frederick S. Miles,
in a wholesale grocery and commission business at Milwaukee.
In 1863 he became the head of the firm of Armour, Plankington
&amp; Co., pork packers, whose headquarters were at Milwaukee. He
also obtained a large interest in the firm H.O. Armour &amp; Co.,
which was founded by his brother, Herman Ossian Armour
(1837-1901), and which, starting as a grain commission business,
in 1868 established also a large pork-packing plant. Of this firm,
the name of which was changed to Armour &amp; Co. in 1870, he
became the head in 1875, and thereafter the business made
such rapid progress that in 1901 as many as 11,000 hands were
employed. Besides contributing to many charitable enterprises,
Armour founded the Armour Institute of Technology at Chicago
in 1892 and the Armour Flats in Chicago, built for the purpose of
supplying at a low rental good homes for working men and their
families. He also contributed liberally to the Armour Mission in
Chicago, which was founded in 1881 by his brother, Joseph
Armour. At the time of his death, on the 6th of January 1901,
Philip D. Armour&rsquo;s private fortune was supposed to exceed
$50,000,000.</p>
